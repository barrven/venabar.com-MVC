- Building a computer for the first time can be daunting; my first attempt didn't go well, with parts sizzling unexpectedly.
- I have two systems to showcase: an "open" case and a "closed" case for comparison.
- While we will build a PC using the open case in this series, I'll also demonstrate features and components from the closed case.
- Always observe safety protocols, such as using an anti-static mat, to prevent electrical damage to components.
- The closed case includes a high-end system with a liquid-cooled CPU, which is not easily visible.
- The open case features an air-cooled CPU, essential for effective airflow. The RAM here is older and likely less suitable for gaming.
- Both systems have back panel connectors, including USB ports, HDMI, DVI, and mini-DIN (PS/2) ports.
- The closed case supports Wi-Fi connectivity via antenna connectors, while the open case includes an older VGA connection and RJ-45 Ethernet for direct internet access.
- An IO shield on the closed case aligns with the motherboard for secure connectivity but can obstruct some views.
- An extra USB root hub can be added via an expansion slot for additional USB ports.
- This overview of PC components prepares us to dismantle and build the open system step-by-step, as detailed in the upcoming series.
