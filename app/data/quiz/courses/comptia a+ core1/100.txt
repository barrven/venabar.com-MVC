- **Cloud Overview**: Clouds encompass servers, storage, and staff to maintain operations. Ownership is significant because it affects control and access.

- **Private Cloud**: This setup involves a group of computers dedicated exclusively to one organization. It allows the creation of virtual machines (VMs) and is restricted to that organization, ensuring privacy and exclusivity.

- **Public Cloud**: Unlike a private cloud, a public cloud is open to anyone. Services such as Amazon S3 and Microsoft Azure allow users to create VMs and upload applications, often including additional features like security. Access is available to any individual with a credit card, making it widely popular.

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines elements of private and public clouds. Part of the cloud is private, while excess capacity may be offered to the public. This setup allows organizations to optimize resources and potentially earn revenue from unused capacity.

- **Community Cloud**: To avoid the high cost of setting up an individual cloud, organizations can collaborate to create a shared cloud. Multiple entities contribute funds to build a joint infrastructure, functioning as a member-exclusive network for those within the community group.
