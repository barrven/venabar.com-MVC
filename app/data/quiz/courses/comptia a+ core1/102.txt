- The A+ exam frequently covers laptops, discussing their unique features. However, be cautious because many questions might involve laptops without the specific problem being related to them.

- Laptops run the same operating systems as desktops, which means most issues that affect desktops can also occur on laptops. Keep this in mind during the exam.

- A key feature of laptops is the function keys, which allow users to extend displays, turn off touchpads, enter economy mode, and toggle airplane mode, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.

- Laptops often include volume and brightness toggle keys, as well as options to control keyboard backlighting, which is useful for working in low-light conditions.

- Some laptops have special gaming modes that optimize performance by maximizing cooling through high-speed fans.

- In the settings menu, users can adjust device settings, such as turning Bluetooth on or off and adjusting touchpad sensitivity.

- Be aware that network issues on laptops, like Wi-Fi connectivity problems, may be due to airplane mode being activated. Older laptops may have a physical button to disable wireless connections, but most now use function keys.

- Location services, enabled through the operating system, can be helpful for tracking lost devices, thanks to built-in GPS.

- Security features like cable locks for laptops provide physical protection by securing the device to a stable object via a lockable port.

- Docking stations and port replicators expand laptop connectivity. Docking stations offer a proprietary connection for additional peripherals, while port replicators function as large USB hubs, extending available USB connections for devices like keyboards and mice.

- For the exam, focus on distinguishing when the mention of laptops is relevant to solving a problem or when features like airplane mode or function keys are crucial for the correct answer.
