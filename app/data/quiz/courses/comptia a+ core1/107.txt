**Understanding Mobile Devices**

- A **mobile device** is defined by its sealed design, meaning it cannot be easily opened for upgrades like memory or hard drives. It's a single-function system.

- These devices operate on specialized operating systems, predominantly **Android and iOS**, though some versions of Linux also serve this purpose in embedded systems.

- **Wireless connectivity** is a staple feature, with support for Wi-Fi (802.11), Bluetooth, Cellular, and sometimes other technologies like Zigbee. Wired connections, if present, mainly serve for charging.

- Common mobile devices include **smartphones** and **tablets**. Smartphones typically use Android or iOS and feature functionalities such as Wi-Fi, cellular connectivity, GPS, accelerometers, and more. Tablets share similar operating systems and features, often used in niche areas like home automation or as point-of-sale systems in restaurants.

- **Smartwatches** and other **wearable technologies** like fitness trackers frequently include sensors for monitoring physical activity and health metrics. These devices often sync with smartphones for comprehensive data tracking.

- **E-readers**, such as the Kindle Paperwhite, are designed for reading digital books with minimal power usage and straightforward functionality, typically not featuring backlights or color displays.

- **GPS devices**, recognized as early smart devices, are self-contained units often running slimmed-down Linux and storing maps internally.

- **Credit card readers**, both swipe and chip variants, provide portable payment processing and often feature wireless connectivity.

- **Expandable storage** through SD or micro SD cards is possible in many Android devices and accessories like GPS units and e-readers. This feature is commonly absent in Apple devices, influencing some users' preference for Android.
