- Configuring email on smart devices can be either simple or challenging. Here, I'll guide you through the email setup process, emphasizing the key points to remember.

- **Setting Up an Email Account**: When setting up email, you're essentially creating an account. You need to be aware of two protocols for incoming email: POP3 and IMAP, and an outgoing protocol: SMTP. POP3 and IMAP manage incoming emails, while SMTP handles outgoing emails.

- **Traditional Email Setup**: To set up a corporate or internet service provider email, you'll typically need several pieces of information:
  - The fully qualified domain name of your SMTP server (e.g., mail.br6.com).
  - Username and password for the SMTP server.
  - Port numbers—standardly, port 25 for SMTP, but secure connections may require ports 465 or 587.
  - Similarly, for IMAP, use the fully qualified domain name and login credentials, with port 143 or 993 for secure connections.

- **Understanding Security**: Email security has improved with protocols like SSL and STARTTLS, which encrypt emails from your device to the server. When setting up manually, you might have to experiment with various settings and contact an email administrator for help if needed.

- **S/MIME and Encryption**: Originally, secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) was used to encrypt email attachments. However, nowadays, emails are generally encrypted end-to-end by default, making S/MIME less relevant. Tools like Proton Mail offer full encryption from sender to recipient.

- **Easy Setup for Commercial Emails**: Setting up accounts with providers like Google, Yahoo, or iCloud is straightforward. These services use proprietary connections that make configuration simple—just enter your email address and password without worrying about ports or detailed server settings.

Overall, while traditional email setup can be complex, modern services dramatically simplify the process by handling much of the configuration automatically.
