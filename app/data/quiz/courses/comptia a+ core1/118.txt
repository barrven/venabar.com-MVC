- An inkjet printer was revolutionary in bringing color printing to the masses and is still widely used today alongside laser printers.
- Inkjet printers use ink cartridges connected to print heads. The ink is heated to create small bubbles that shoot the ink out, allowing for color mixing and precise printing. 
- These printers often include multiple colors: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (CMYK).
- A print head containing multiple jets moves across the paper, propelled by a belt and rollers, to apply ink over an entire sheet.
- The advantages of inkjet printers include less heat and voltage exposure, making them generally safer than laser printers.
- Many inkjet printers are multifunction devices, including scanning and faxing capabilities, popular in offices.
- Maintenance includes clearing nozzle clogs, calibrating jets, and regularly replacing ink cartridges due to usage. Maintenance software on computers assists in monitoring ink levels.
- Common issues with inkjets include frequent ink cartridge replacements due to high consumption and potential paper jams from paper dander or misfeeds.
- Despite some drawbacks, such as maintenance demands and ink expenses, inkjets are feature-rich and form a critical part of tech certification exams.
