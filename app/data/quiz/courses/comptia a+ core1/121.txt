To use a printer, you must connect it first. There are three ways to connect to printers: local, network, and cloud. This guide focuses on setting up a local printer. 

**Connecting a Local Printer:**
- **USB Connection:** Most printers, including inkjet, thermal, impact, and laser printers, use USB connections. It's the primary and most common method.
- **Serial Connection:** Some printers, like thermal ones used in point-of-sale systems, may use serial connections instead of USB.

**Printer Setup:**
1. Unpack the printer carefully, removing all packing materials.
2. Ensure the printer has necessary supplies, like toner or ink, and load paper.
3. Connect the printer to your system using a USB cable.
4. Turn on the printer and check if the system recognizes it automatically. Most modern operating systems like Windows and Mac OS can detect printers and install drivers automatically. If not, download drivers from the manufacturer's website.

**Printer Configuration:**
- **Accessing Printer Settings:** Use the operating system to access device settings and properties.
- **Printer Properties:** Here, you can rename the printer, test print, and configure port settings.
- **Printing Preferences:** Adjust settings like media type, color mode, orientation, and the number of copies. Advanced printers may offer features like collation and duplex printing.

**Print Spooler:**
- This software queues print jobs and processes them in order. Ensure you have permissions to manage the spooler, pause or cancel print jobs.

**Virtual Printers:**
- These options (Print to PDF, XPS Document Writer, Print to OneNote) allow you to "print" to digital files or applications rather than physical paper.

**Default Printer:**
- Set your preferred printer as the default to avoid unwanted prints to virtual printers. This is done in the Control Panel under devices and printers.

**Next Steps:**
Currently, only the user connected to the printer can use it. To enable sharing with others, further setup is needed, which will be covered in other guides.
