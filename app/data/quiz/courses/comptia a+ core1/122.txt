- I have an inkjet printer connected directly to my computer via USB. Currently, only I can use it, but I want to share it with others. 
- To share the printer, I need to go to the Control Panel and select "Devices and Printers."
- Once there, I click on "Printer Properties" and then "Sharing." I opt to share the printer and can choose a simpler name for it, like "Brother," for network visibility.
- I can let client computers render their print jobs or handle it through my computer's spooler. I set it to list in the directory for easy network access.
- I need to consider additional drivers for other systems that might use this printer, such as 32-bit Windows or devices using ARM processors. Currently, I only support 64-bit Windows.
- After sharing, Windows defaults to allowing anyone to print. I can modify permissions under the "Security" tab in the printer properties. Options include managing the printer or documents, meant for handling print issues like deleting documents if needed.
- For a domain, user permissions need setting, but Windows generally does well managing it automatically.
- To access this shared printer on another Windows system, I can go to "Printers & Scanners" and select "Add a printer or scanner." If it doesn't automatically find it, I can enter the printer's network path manually.
- Privacy risks exist as this printer is a multifunction device capable of sending faxes or saving files to places like Google Drive. It’s important to disable unwanted features for security.
- User authentication is necessary to manage the print spooler and ensure permissions are correctly set, affecting tasks like pausing or stopping print jobs.
