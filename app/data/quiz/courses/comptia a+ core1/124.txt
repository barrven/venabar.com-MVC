Here's a concise and clear summary of the essential printer troubleshooting tips and problems often encountered in exams and real-life scenarios:

- **Unable to Install Printer**: This typically occurs due to lack of installation rights or the printer not being shared on the network. Check for administrative permissions and ensure the printer is connected to the network.

- **No Connectivity**: If a previously working printer is suddenly unavailable, verify if it's physically connected and has a good DHCP lease. It might also indicate a general network issue. 

- **Access Denied**: This is usually an administrative issue. Ensure you have print permissions or spooler access rights to manage print jobs.

- **No Display on Printer**: Check if the printer is turned on or in sleep mode. A faulty display or administrative lock might be the cause.

- **Paper Issues (Jams/Not Feeding)**: Often due to worn-out pickup rollers or separator pads. Maintenance kits are available for replacement. Additionally, humidity can affect paper quality.

- **Low Memory Errors**: Common in laser printers. Options include lowering print resolution or upgrading RAM with standard, non-specialty types.

- **Error Codes**: Use error codes to diagnose issues. They often point to specific problems like being out of paper (e.g., PC Load Letter).

- **Garbled Characters on Paper**: Likely due to bad or corrupted drivers or print jobs. Clear the printer's spooler and reset the printer.

- **Vertical Lines on Page**: Typically a laser printer issue indicating foreign matter on the optical roller. Toner cartridges might need replacement.

- **Wrong Print Colors**: Could stem from driver errors or depleted ink colors in cartridges.

- **Printing Blank Pages**: Indicates a technology issue, such as a malfunctioning heating element or corona wire.

- **Streaks or Faded Prints**: For inkjets, streaks can be due to clogged nozzles. Fading usually suggests low toner or worn-out ribbons.

- **Ghost Images**: Often seen with laser printers when the cleaning step fails, requiring toner replacement.

- **Toner Not Fusing to Paper**: Points to a problem with the fuser assembly, which can typically be replaced.

- **Creased Paper**: Caused by uneven wear on the pickup rollers. A maintenance kit can solve this.

Focus on understanding these troubleshooting methods to effectively address and resolve common printer issues.
