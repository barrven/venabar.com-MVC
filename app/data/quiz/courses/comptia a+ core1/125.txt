- 3D printing has become an integral part of discussions about printing technology, especially with its inclusion in the A+ exam.
- A 3D printer works by moving a heating element back and forth over a table, extruding a shape using a thin stream of heated thermoplastic, based on 3D images.
- To create these images, you can design in 3D programs like Blender and then prepare the design for printing using slicing software. One such program is Cura.
- The preparation process involves setting parameters like layer height (determines the thickness of each layer) and infill (controls how much of the inside is solid for structural strength).
- Additional features include support structures (to prevent parts from tilting) and build plate adhesion (to help parts adhere better to the printer's base).
- Different types of filament, such as PLA, are used in 3D printing. They need to be melted and quickly harden to form objects. Some printers also work with metal.
- Once the design is ready, it's saved as a slice file, often referred to as gcode, and transferred to the printer via USB or SSD.
- The printing process then begins, constructing the object layer by layer.
- It's important to monitor the filament supply, as 3D printing can consume a lot of material.
- Understanding 3D printing involves knowledge of thermoplastic filaments, extruder functionality, 3D image creation, slicing processes, and managing filament usage.
