Understanding CPU nomenclature is crucial for making informed choices when selecting a CPU for yourself or a client. Let's break down the key components of a CPU's name using the examples: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X and Intel Core i9-12900K.

1. **Brand**: CPUs are primarily from two brands, AMD and Intel, indicated at the start of the name.
   
2. **Tier**: This indicates performance levels. Higher tiers, like i9 or Ryzen 9, are more powerful than lower tiers, such as i5 or Ryzen 5.

3. **Generation**: The first digit in the numeric sequence shows the generation, signifying the CPU's age and the technologies it supports. Newer generations often include enhanced capabilities like better instruction handling per cycle.

4. **Model**: This number helps compare performance within the same generation. For example, among the fifth generation, a higher model number like Ryzen 9 5900X suggests superior performance within that generation group.

5. **Suffixes**:
   - Intel's "K" means the CPU is unlocked for overclocking.
   - Intel's "F" indicates no integrated graphics, useful when adding a dedicated graphics card.
   - AMD's "X" denotes a higher base clock speed, implying it’s mildly overclocked out of the box.
   - AMD's "G" suggests the presence of integrated graphics.
