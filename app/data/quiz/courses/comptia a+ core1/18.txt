### Installing a CPU: A Step-by-Step Guide

- **Preparation:**
  - Use ESD protection to avoid static damage. Stand on an anti-static mat.
  - Handle CPUs carefully, avoiding contact with delicate pins. Wear gloves if necessary.

- **Understanding CPU Sockets:**
  - **Intel CPUs**: Use Land Grid Array (LGA) sockets with flat connections.
  - **AMD CPUs**: Use Pin Grid Array (PGA) sockets with pins that fit into holes.

- **Installation Process:**
  1. Identify the orientation notches on the CPU and the socket.
  2. Align and gently insert the CPU; use the zero-insertion force (ZIF) mechanism to secure it.

- **Troubleshooting:**
  - **Step 1: Identify the Problem** - Check for bent or broken pins that prevent proper CPU fit or function.
  - **Step 2: Establish a Theory** - Consider possible causes and confirm by checking obvious issues.
  - **Step 3: Test the Theory** - Attempt to correct the issue, such as straightening bent pins.
  - **Step 4: Implement a Solution** - Develop a plan based on vendor instructions and execute it.
  - **Step 5: Verify Functionality** - Ensure the system works correctly and implement preventive measures.
  - **Step 6: Document Findings** - Record the issue, steps taken, and outcomes for future reference.

By following these steps and handling components carefully, you can efficiently install and troubleshoot CPUs.
