- **RAM Types and Technologies:**

  - **SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM):** 
    - First widely used RAM type, synchronized with the CPU's clock.
    - Identified by 168 pins and two notches.
    - Speed matched to motherboard speed (e.g., 66 MHz, 100 MHz).

  - **DDR (Double Data Rate SDRAM):**
    - Provides two bits of data per clock cycle, doubling data rate.
    - Uses 184 pins with a single notch.
    - Speeds denoted as DDR followed by a number (e.g., DDR-266). 
    - PC rating (e.g., PC-1600) measures speed in bits (DDR speed multiplied by 8).

  - **DDR2:**
    - Further improves speed using prefetch technique, making it four times faster than SDRAM.
    - Uses 240 pins; notches slightly offset from DDR.
    - Speeds indicated by DDR2 or PC2 ratings (e.g., DDR2-400, PC2-3200).

  - **DDR3:**
    - Doubles speed from DDR2, with increased bandwidth.
    - Also uses 240 pins, but notches are more noticeably offset.
    - Speeds indicated as DDR3 or PC3 (e.g., DDR3-800, PC3-6400).

  - **DDR4:**
    - Uses 288 pins with distinct notch placement, ensuring compatibility.
    - Known for high speeds and high bandwidth, indicated in MT/s (mega transfers per second).
    - Rated as DDR4 or PC4 (e.g., DDR4-2133, PC4-17000).

- **Considerations for Buying RAM:**
  - Always match RAM type and speed with the motherboard's requirements.
  - Use pin count and notch placement to ensure compatibility.
  - Check for speed ratings on the RAM packaging to confirm it meets specifications.
  - Older RAM like DDR2 is still available and used in specific systems or devices.
