- RAM (Random Access Memory) sticks come with a specific storage capacity, expressed in bytes. The capacity isn't visible just by inspecting the chips and is unrelated to types like DDR, DDR2, or DDR3, which only indicate speed.

- RAM chips are organized in a square pattern. Doubling each side effectively quadruples the capacity. For example, a 256MB RAM's next capacities might be 1GB, 4GB, and then 16GB.

- RAM can be single-sided or double-sided, meaning it may have memory chips on one or both sides, respectively. Double-sided RAM is common, but certain motherboards may not support it, so checking your motherboard's compatibility is crucial.

- Motherboards generally have multiple RAM slots for flexibility, with common configurations being four slots. More slots are typical in server systems, with some having eight or more.

- Total RAM is calculated by adding the capacities of all installed RAM sticks. For instance, two 8GB sticks equal 16GB of RAM.

- Most modern motherboards use a concept known as channels. Dual-channel configurations need RAM sticks of identical size and speed installed in specific matched slots to maximize performance.

- Many motherboards won't boot with a single stick in a dual-channel system. If it does boot, it may show a "Running in single-channel mode" warning, indicating it’s not optimized.

- When using channels, it's essential to install RAM sticks with identical speed and capacity in the same channel. Different capacities can be used across channels, but it's advisable to maintain consistency for optimal performance.

- When faced with a motherboard having limited RAM slots (e.g., two), upgrading may require removing existing sticks to replace them with higher capacity ones, a detail many find confusing.

- Motherboards today are predominantly dual-channel, making them the primary source of instruction for proper RAM configuration. Always reference the motherboard manual to ensure optimal RAM installation and performance.
