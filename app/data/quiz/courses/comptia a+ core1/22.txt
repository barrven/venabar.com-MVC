- You can't have too much RAM in a computer. RAM is crucial for running programs, and if you run out of it, you'll encounter an "out of memory" error. This stops further operation.

- To illustrate, imagine a beaker representing your computer's RAM, marked up to 16 gigabytes. The operating system, like Windows, uses part of this RAM, typically around 2 gigabytes. As you open more programs, they fill up the RAM.

- When RAM is insufficient, the computer uses a portion of the hard drive as a temporary RAM substitute. This is called virtual memory, which every operating system has. However, it is not ideal to rely on virtual memory since it's slower and can lead to performance issues.

- On Windows 10, virtual memory settings can be accessed via System Properties under Advanced settings. By default, Windows automatically manages the size of the paging file (the part of the hard drive acting as virtual memory).

- The paging file, often named swapfile.sys, starts small but can expand if needed. However, using virtual memory noticeably slows down your computer because it involves writing to the hard drive instead of RAM.

- If your computer relies heavily on virtual memory, it will slow down, and the hard drive activity light will flash frequently. The best solution is to add more RAM to avoid these issues.
