- When upgrading RAM to boost system performance, knowing how to install and troubleshoot RAM is essential.

- Sometimes, RAM doesn't fit into the motherboard's slot due to compatibility issues.

- To troubleshoot, apply CompTIA A+ troubleshooting steps:
  1. **Identify the Problem**: The RAM doesn't fit the slot, probably due to type mismatch.
  2. **Establish a Theory**: Likely, the RAM is the wrong type for the motherboard.
  3. **Test the Theory**: 
      - Consult manufacturer's information to verify correct installation.
      - Check if the RAM sticks are the correct generation by trying known compatible RAM (e.g., DDR4).
  4. **Plan and Implement a Solution**: Use the known compatible DDR4 RAM sticks; they should fit the motherboard correctly.
  5. **Verify System Functionality**: Ensure the system works with the installed RAM.
  6. **Document Findings**: Maintaining a record of troubleshooting steps and discoveries aids future IT work.

By following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve RAM installation issues.
