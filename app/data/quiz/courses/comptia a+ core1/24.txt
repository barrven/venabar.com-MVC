- A motherboard is a central component of a computer that connects various hardware parts, such as RAM, CPU, USB devices, wireless adapters, audio outputs, network connections, and hard drives. 
- It assumes standard hardware usage, like keyboards, mice, and storage devices, ensuring interconnectivity even before the operating system boots.
- The BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is firmware built into every motherboard. It enables communication with hardware without using operating system-specific drivers.
- BIOS is integral for initial system checks, including the Power-On Self-Test (POST), which ensures hardware functionality before booting an operating system.
- Modern motherboards often have dual BIOS chips for redundancy. This ensures that a backup is available if the primary BIOS becomes corrupted.
- Companies such as AMI, Phoenix, and Gigabyte develop and distribute BIOS firmware.
- BIOS also encompasses the System Setup or CMOS, which handles configuration settings for system hardware.
- BIOS firmware is crucial for hardware testing and ensures effective communication with primary computer components. More detailed functionalities of BIOS will be covered in further episodes.
