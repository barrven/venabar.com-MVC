- Computers don't have a "run" button; they have an on/off switch that provides power. The CPU then uses a power good wire to start running.
- The CPU first interacts with the BIOS and initiates the Power-On Self-Test (POST), a basic diagnostic program.
- During POST, components like memory controllers, RAM, and USB controllers check themselves and report back to the CPU.
- A successful POST makes a beep sound, indicating that the system is functioning properly. This beep comes from a small internal speaker, not an external sound system.
- POST checks crucial components such as CPU, RAM, and video. If there's an issue, it uses beep codes to communicate errors.
- Beep codes are simple error signals, with each type having a distinct sound, indicating different issues (e.g., missing video card or RAM).
- If the system passes the initial POST, information displays on the monitor, such as chip types, CPU speed, and boot devices. Errors might appear in plain text on-screen.
- In cases where beep or display codes are not possible, a POST card can diagnose issues. These cards show hexadecimal codes indicating different error states.
- POST cards plug into a motherboard and display codes during boot-up. A codebook or motherboard manual provides meanings for these codes (e.g., "2B" denotes a memory initialization problem).
- Detailed and costly diagnostic POST cards are unnecessary; affordable options are available for about $30. These are useful when building or troubleshooting new systems.
