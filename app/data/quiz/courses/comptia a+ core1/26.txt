- Over time, PCs have advanced from 16-bit to 64-bit systems, with improvements in operating systems, hard drives, RAM, CPUs, and connectivity. However, BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) had remained a 16-bit program until recently.
  
- The BIOS has been largely replaced by the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), which is more powerful and allows for better system management. Nonetheless, it is commonly referred to as UEFI BIOS.

- BIOS is responsible for communicating with the computer's hardware, but hardware changes, like new hard drives or USB devices, require adjustments in BIOS through an interface known as System Setup.

- Accessing System Setup typically involves pressing keys like Delete or F2 during startup, as indicated on the screen. This step precedes the operating system's booting process.

- Once in System Setup, users can modify various options such as setting administrator and user passwords, which secure access to BIOS settings and the computer's boot sequence.

- The System Setup offers different modes, including an advanced mode for more detailed configurations, and options like overclocking, which can be explored.

- Key sections within the setup include Main, Advanced, and Boot. The Main section provides system information and options for changing basic settings like the system language and date.

- The Advanced section allows for configuring onboard device settings, such as enabling or disabling sound cards or network interfaces and even serial ports on certain motherboards.

- The Boot section manages boot device priorities. Users can specify which storage devices to boot from, enhancing security by limiting boot options to internal storage, and preventing unauthorized access via removable media.

- BIOS updates can be performed within the setup, known as flashing. Users can update BIOS via USB storage or directly from the internet, although this process is advised to be approached with caution.

- The goal of the System Setup tutorial is to familiarize users with accessing and navigating BIOS settings. As users continue learning, they will revisit System Setup to enhance their understanding of BIOS functions.
