- Building your own computer system is exciting because you can mix and match parts like the motherboard and the case, which usually fit together due to industry standards. These standards, known as form factors, define the size and placement of components like motherboards, cases, and power supplies.

- In this discussion, we'll focus on form factors relevant to the A+ exam. On the desk are three different sized motherboards:

  - **ATX**: Measures 12 inches by 9.6 inches and is the most common and popular form factor.
  
  - **Micro ATX**: A smaller version at 9.6 by 9.6 inches, with a similar layout to ATX but more compact.
  
  - **Mini ITX**: Even smaller, designed for compact systems like home theater or point-of-sale devices, but still compatible with standard processors and RAM.

- There’s also the **ITX** form factor, a larger version of the mini ITX, which is rarely encountered and not covered in-depth on the exam.

- Form factors influence more than just motherboard sizes. For example, a standard ATX power supply comes with connectors that fit any of these motherboards due to standardized designs.

- Additionally, motherboards include an IO shield, which, regardless of being mini ITX, micro ATX, or ATX, follows a standardized shape allowing them to fit seamlessly into cases.

- This compatibility ensures you can place almost any motherboard into any appropriately sized case, ensuring good airflow and appearance, all thanks to the standardization of form factors.
