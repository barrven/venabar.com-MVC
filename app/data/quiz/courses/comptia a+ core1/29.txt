- The original PC motherboards were complex, filled with individual chips for specific tasks. Chips controlled hard drives, floppy drives, sound cards, serial ports, and mice. This setup was normal during the first 10-15 years of PCs.

- Over time, manufacturers created chipsets to consolidate these functions. Early chipsets consisted of two chips: the northbridge and the southbridge. The northbridge managed the CPU interface and high-speed tasks, while the southbridge handled slower connections like USB ports.

- Modern CPUs incorporate northbridge functions, leaving the chipset as primarily the southbridge. Today's chipsets are vital for determining a system's capabilities. They define RAM capacity, video card support, RAM speed, USB port number and speed, and hard drive capacity.

- When buying a motherboard, the critical component is the chipset. Motherboard manufacturers emphasize chipsets, such as X299, X470, B360N, as they determine system features. A single CPU can support multiple chipsets, each offering different functionalities.

- When building a system, more emphasis should be placed on selecting the right chipset, not just the CPU, to ensure the system meets specific needs.
