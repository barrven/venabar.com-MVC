When selecting a motherboard for your PC, it's crucial to consider a few key factors to ensure compatibility and meet your needs. A motherboard, sometimes called a mainboard, system board, or mobo, is essentially the backbone of your computer, determining which components you can use. Here are the main aspects to consider:

- **Intended Use**: Decide if the build is for a desktop, laptop, or something more complex like a server with multi-socket capabilities. For this guide, we'll focus on a gaming PC build.

- **Compatibility**: Tools like PC Part Picker help you ensure the components are compatible. For instance, if you've chosen an Intel Core i9 CPU, it will only show motherboards with the right LGA slots.

- **Form Factor**: Determine the size of the motherboard, such as full-size ATX, smaller micro-ATX, or mini-ITX, based on the space available and your preference for system size.

- **Features**: Identify the features you need, such as the maximum RAM capacity, number of expansion ports, built-in Wi-Fi, etc.

- **Aesthetics**: Consider the design and color of your motherboard, including aspects like LEDs, which can contribute to the visual appeal of your build.

PC Part Picker also shows estimated wattage to help ensure your power supply unit (PSU) meets your system's needs. By examining these factors, you can choose a motherboard that both functions well and meets your aesthetic preferences.
