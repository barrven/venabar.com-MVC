When purchasing a power supply, you'll see it rated in watts. While it's true that volts times amps equals watts, this formula assumes perfect efficiency, which doesn't occur in real-world conditions. Power supplies aren't 100% efficient, meaning some electricity from your wall outlet is lost as heat. This inefficiency was a significant issue in older power supplies and led to the creation of the "80 Plus" rating system. 

When buying a power supply, you'll notice two ratings: wattage and the 80 Plus efficiency rating. Modern power supplies have various efficiency levels, classified as 80 Plus, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Titanium. These ratings help you identify the real wattage output at different loads. 

For your system, calculate your wattage needs based on components like your motherboard, video cards, and hard drives. Then, choose a power supply providing a bit more wattage as a buffer. If you've estimated that you need 700 watts, remember that your system will only require that full capacity occasionally. 

Another consideration is whether to opt for a modular or soldered power supply. Modular power supplies let you connect only the cables you need, but some argue this marginally reduces efficiency compared to soldered connections. 

Most systems use standard ATX-sized power supplies, which fit many computers, including small form factors. However, smaller sized ATX power supplies exist for smaller systems. 

In summary, choose a power supply with appropriate wattage, consider the 80 Plus efficiency rating, and decide between modular and soldered connections based on your preferences.
