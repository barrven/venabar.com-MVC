- We've previously discussed heat sinks, fans, and liquid cooling for lowering component temperatures. Now, let's focus on keeping your system cool during demanding tasks.

- First, examine your closed case. Notice how well-organized the cables are; they are routed neatly behind the motherboard and only emerge where needed. This excellent cable management is crucial for maintaining proper airflow and cooling.

- The case contains several fans: two at the front, one at the bottom, and more at the back and top. This setup allows cool air to intake through the front and bottom and exhausts warm air from the back and top, ensuring an efficient cooling cycle.

- Cable management isn't the only key to airflow. Keep your system dust-free using canned air or a PC blower to maintain smooth airflow. Regular cleaning helps sustain the system's cooling efficiency.

- Lastly, explore the BIOS settings. Most modern BIOS have thermal settings under a Hardware Monitor section, allowing you to control system fan speeds. You can enable smart fan mode or manually adjust settings to optimize cooling.

- In summary, ensure good cable management, regularly clean components, and configure BIOS settings to maintain efficient system cooling.
