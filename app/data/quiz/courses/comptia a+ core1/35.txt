- Understanding how to install and troubleshoot power supplies (PSUs) is a crucial skill for PC technicians. While installation is generally straightforward, caution is necessary as it involves live electricity. Here's a guide on how to install and troubleshoot a PSU.

- **Installation of a Non-Modular Power Supply**: 
  - Use a non-modular PSU, where wires are pre-attached.
  - Ensure the PSU is unplugged before handling. ATX power supplies can retain active power.
  - Orient the PSU correctly in the case, align the screw holes, and secure it with screws.

- **Using a Modular Power Supply**:
  - Modular PSUs only require you to connect necessary cables, reducing clutter.
  - Notice that connectors have specific shapes (rounded or square) to simplify alignment.
  - Connect the 24-pin motherboard cable and CPU power cable, ensuring each is securely attached and clicked into place.

- **Troubleshooting Power Issues**:
  - Symptoms include random shutdowns or reboots, no power, or error codes from the motherboard speaker.
  - First, ensure proper handling by disconnecting the PSU from power.
  - Use a power supply tester by connecting the 20+4 and 8-pin CPU connectors to diagnose issues.
  - Compare the tester's readings to PSU specifications to verify proper function.

- **Establishing and Testing a Theory**:
  - If issues persist, test the cable connections. A common problem is cables not being firmly seated.
  - Disconnect all cables, then reconnect, making sure they are secured until a click is heard.
  - Verify system functionality by powering on the system after reseating the cables.

- **Key Points**:
  - Document findings and note that loose connections are a frequent oversight, especially when assembling systems quickly.
  - Follow the CompTIA A+ troubleshooting steps to isolate and resolve issues, ensuring a thorough diagnostic process.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can effectively troubleshoot and resolve power supply-related issues in a PC setup.
