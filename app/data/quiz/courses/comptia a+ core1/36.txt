- Computers require various storage devices to store large files like videos, games, and operating systems. These devices include optical media, spinning hard drives, and popular solid-state drives (SSDs).

- Each storage device has a minimum unit of storage, or "atom." Hard drives have sectors, typically 512 or 4,096 bytes. SSDs use blocks, about a thousand bytes each, and optical media use tracks, around a little over a thousand bytes.

- All storage devices use Logical Block Addressing (LBA), which acts as an interface between your operating system and storage devices. LBA helps manage file storage without needing individual device drivers.

- Storage device capacity can be measured in two ways: decimal (e.g., kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes) and binary (e.g., kibibytes, mebibytes, gibibytes). These measurement systems have similar but slightly different values, which can lead to discrepancies in reported storage capacity.

- Physical sizes of storage devices include:
  - 5.25-inch for optical media
  - 3.5-inch for high-capacity hard drives
  - 2.5-inch for mobile devices and servers
  - 1.8-inch, although less common, for some SSDs
  - M.2 is the prevalent standard for SSDs today

- Understanding LBA, capacity counting methods, and physical sizes is essential as you explore various storage devices.
