- The most popular mass storage in modern systems is the solid-state drive (SSD). While hard disk drives (HDDs) still have a role, SSDs are favored for their speed, making them ideal for boot systems. Systems often use both SSDs and HDDs together.

- SSDs typically come in two sizes: the 2.5 inch format and the smaller, more compact M.2. The 2.5 inch format is common, recognizable by its case, while M.2 drives look like small sticks, available in various lengths.

- A key challenge with SSDs is the interface. Early SSDs used the SATA interface, the same as HDDs, allowing them to be interchangeable. However, SSDs’ speed necessitated a faster interface, leading to the development of NVMe, which supports quicker data transfer compared to SATA.

- NVMe drives typically come in the M.2 format, identified by a single notch; whereas, SATA-based M.2 drives have two notches. It's important to match the M.2 connector on the motherboard with the drive type to ensure compatibility.

- When purchasing M.2 drives, verify that the motherboard supports the intended interface (SATA or NVMe). This ensures optimal performance and avoids compatibility issues.

- Installing an NVMe M.2 drive involves inserting it into the motherboard's M.2 slot, securing it with a screw, and replacing the heatsink. Once installed, the system setup should recognize the drive.

- Installing a traditional SATA SSD involves connecting it to the power supply and data ports. It can be used alongside the NVMe M.2 drive, enabling a system to recognize and utilize multiple storage drives.

- After physical installation, the operating system setup must configure the drives for use with Windows, Linux, or macOS, ensuring the system can access and manage the storage efficiently.
