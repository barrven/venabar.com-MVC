- Today's mass storage primarily uses the ATA interface, with SATA being the most common for hard drives and SSDs. 
- Historically, mass storage used parallel interfaces. One was Parallel ATA (PATA), which featured multiple wires transmitting data simultaneously. 
- Another was SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface), known for its wider, parallel connections. SCSI and ATA were incompatible rivals, requiring specific controllers for each.
- PATA systems supported limited drive connections, whereas SCSI allowed up to 15 drives, making it popular in server environments.
- Modern storage uses serial connections, eliminating wide parallel cables. SCSI evolved into Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), resembling but not fully compatible with SATA connections.
- SCSI persists in server environments, particularly as iSCSI, where SCSI devices connect over Ethernet.
- It’s important to understand terms like SAS and iSCSI, as they may appear in server settings and on relevant exams.
