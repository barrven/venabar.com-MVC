- Early disk drives were costly, but their prices have decreased significantly over time. 
- Engineers at Berkeley developed the concept of RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) to enhance speed and data redundancy by using multiple drives together.
- RAID levels, such as RAID 0, 1, 5, 6, 10, and 0+1, define how drives are utilized to offer different combinations of performance and data protection:

  - **RAID 0 (Striping):** Requires at least two drives; provides speed by splitting data across drives but offers no redundancy. If one drive fails, all data is lost.

  - **RAID 1 (Mirroring):** Uses two drives to duplicate data, ensuring data safety. It can be slower as the same data is written on both drives.

  - **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity):** Needs a minimum of three drives. It offers both speed and redundancy by storing parity information, allowing recovery if a single drive fails.

  - **RAID 6:** Similar to RAID 5 but requires at least four drives and allows for the failure of up to two drives, providing increased data protection.

  - **RAID 10 (1+0):** Combines mirroring and striping across four drives, offering redundancy and speed. Two mirrored pairs are striped for greater efficiency.

  - **RAID 0+1:** This technique stripes data and then mirrors the striped sets. It also requires a minimum of four drives.

- RAID can be implemented via hardware (using dedicated controllers on motherboards or cards) or software (through operating systems).
- Proprietary RAID systems, like those from Synology or Microsoft Windows' Storage Spaces, offer unique formats with efficiencies and features not disclosed to users.
- Understanding and selecting the appropriate RAID level depends on specific needs for speed, redundancy, and available resources.
