- The most enjoyable way to learn about RAID is through hardware RAID, which involves using a high-end controller to manage hard drives as RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 10, or others. This controller configures the drives so that they appear as a single drive letter when booted into the operating system. 

- Many modern desktop motherboards come with built-in RAID controllers, eliminating the need for expensive add-ons. In this setup, I have four identical four-terabyte hard drives.

- Initially, you need to access the motherboard settings and change from AHCI mode (standard hard drive mode) to RAID mode. This triggers a new setup process specifically for configuring the RAID array.

- After changing the mode, the system setup will show us the available drives. By selecting RAID mode, the individual drives are set to work collectively as a RAID array.

- In the configuration screen, you choose which type of RAID array to create. Options may include RAID0 and RAID10. Sometimes, additional licenses may be required for RAID5.

- After selecting RAID10 and confirming, the array is created. The operating system, such as Windows, will then recognize this new configuration, typically as a single two-terabyte drive.

- RAID setups offer features like hot spares, which are backup drives that automatically activate if one drive fails. A hot spare sits idle until it's needed, but it’s not physically swapped.

- For full hot-swappable capability (changing drives without shutting down the system), a more advanced controller than what's typically built-in may be necessary. Advanced controllers, costing around $300 to $400, offer more features and control without extra licensing fees.
