- I love my laptop because it's powerful and meets my needs. However, its portability means I often leave it behind in places like Ubers or trains, which is risky because it stores company secrets. Hence, this discussion is about encryption to protect my data.

- Encryption can be applied to storage devices to prevent unauthorized access. I focus on two devices: my laptop's SSD (with Windows and two partitions) and a thumb drive.

- Encryption methods include file-based and disk-based. File-based encryption targets specific files or folders using built-in OS features. Disk-based encryption involves encrypting entire drives using tools like BitLocker for Windows, FileVault for macOS, or various options for Linux.

- On Windows, Encrypting File System (EFS) allows file or folder encryption if formatted with NTFS. I demonstrated using EFS by encrypting a confidential PDF on my desktop: right-click, select Properties, choose Advanced under Attributes, and enable "Encrypt contents to secure data."

- Disk-based encryption, like BitLocker, offers high-level security for whole partitions. It requires a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as a key. Without TPM, the drive cannot be accessed if removed from the system.

- To enable TPM, go into system setup, usually under a Security tab, and ensure it’s activated. Once enabled, you can initiate BitLocker via the Control Panel. BitLocker secures the drive using the TPM chip, or a recovery key if the motherboard fails.

- For removable media, BitLocker To Go doesn't require TPM and uses a password instead. This ensures even thumb drives are protected.

- Ultimately, using EFS, BitLocker, and BitLocker To Go secures data on files, drives, and removable devices, keeping sensitive information safe from unauthorized access.
