- Most people know USB as a simple and reliable way to connect devices like mice, keyboards, or external drives to computers. When you plug a USB device into a computer, a USB controller on the motherboard, which acts like a small network, manages the connection.

- USB connections involve upstream and downstream communication. The motherboard's controller sends commands downstream to connected devices. USB connectors come in two types: A connectors for downstream and B connectors for upstream communication. A USB device will typically have one of each type.

- Various connector types exist, such as USB-A (common for many devices) and USB-B (often soldered internally). USB-C connectors have streamlined this process by allowing reversible and negotiable plug-ins, eliminating the strict A and B distinction.

- Inside a computer, the USB controller, often found in the south bridge of the motherboard, connects to root hubs. These hubs manage the data flow between different USB versions—such as USB 1.1 or USB 3.1—and the ports available for device connection.

- USB can support up to 127 devices through additional USB hubs, which plug into existing ports to expand connectivity. Hubs can be either bus-powered or require external power via AC adapters for additional energy support.

- In Windows, you can manage USB connections using the Device Manager, where controllers and root hubs are listed. USB technology is designed to be user-friendly and largely automated, simply requiring you to plug in a device to start using it.
