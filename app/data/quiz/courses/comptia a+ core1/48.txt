- **Thunderbolt** is a versatile connection that combines PCIe and DisplayPort capabilities, allowing it to drive monitors, enable charging, and support data transfer. There are three versions:
  - Version 1 operates with a two-channel setup at 20 Gbps.
  - Version 2 also offers 20 Gbps.
  - Version 3 provides speeds up to 40 Gbps and uses a USB-C type connector, whereas Versions 1 and 2 use mini DisplayPort connectors.

- **USB-C Compatibility:** Although Thunderbolt 3 uses a USB-C connector, it is a different standard from USB-C. However, there is compatibility, so USB-C devices like mice can work with Thunderbolt connections without issues.

- **Identifying Thunderbolt Ports:** Thunderbolt ports often have a lightning bolt symbol to indicate readiness and capability.

- **Lightning Connectors** are proprietary to Apple and are used for charging and data transfer in iOS devices. They are separate from macOS systems typically equipped with Thunderbolt connectors.

- **Exceptions and Interchangeability:** Some exceptions, such as earbuds and wireless devices, might use Lightning connectors even in macOS environments. Increased Thunderbolt and USB-C adoption in macOS devices allows for better interchangeability, like using a USB-C device with Thunderbolt-equipped macOS without problems. 

In summary, Thunderbolt and Lightning connections serve different roles, with Thunderbolt offering broader compatibility and usage options across various devices, while Lightning remains exclusive to Apple products.
