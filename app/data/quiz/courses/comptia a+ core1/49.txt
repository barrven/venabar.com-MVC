Optical media, like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays, are shiny round disks used to store data since the 1980s. Although their popularity is declining, many systems still have optical drives, especially useful for system builders who often receive driver discs in this format. 

**CDs (Compact Discs):** 
- Originally designed for music storage, using tiny pits to digitally represent data as 'ones' and 'zeros.'
- Offered in two capacities: 74-minute and 80-minute.
- Expanded to store data as CD-ROMs, which use the ISO-9660 file system to display data on computers.
- Writable versions include CD-R (write-once) and CD-RW (rewritable).

**DVDs (Digital Video Discs):**
- Initially created for movies, providing larger capacities and adding features like surround sound.
- Available in dual-layer and double-sided formats for increased storage.
- DVD-ROMs are widely used for data storage, especially for software and drivers.
- Include variants like DVD+R, DVD-R (write-once), and rewritable ones like DVD+RW, DVD-RW, with past compatibility issues now resolved.

**Blu-rays:**
- Designed for high-definition movies with significantly higher capacities (25GB, 50GB).
- Include both writable and rewritable options, such as BD-RE.

**Optical Drives:**
- Modern drives can read and write all these formats and connect via SATA interfaces.
- They feature a manual eject mechanism for disk retrieval without power.

Optical drives are easy to install—simply plug them into the SATA data and power ports, and they should appear in system settings and operating systems like Windows.
