- Peripherals expand a system's capabilities by adding features like printing, sound, video gaming, and external storage. They also support devices like keyboards and mice. Recognizing different peripherals is crucial for becoming a proficient PC technician.

- Let's explore some common peripherals:
  - **Keyboards**: The standard, sometimes wireless, keyboard can vary, such as the smaller 10 Keyless (TKL) version, which lacks the number pad on the right. One-handed gaming keyboards are also available with macro keys for specialized tasks.
  - **Game Controllers**: Essential for modern gaming, these can be used with both consoles and PCs and offer a comfortable grip.
  - **Webcams**: USB devices often used today, suggesting a security tip of covering the camera when not in use.
  - **Joysticks**: While less common, they are still used, especially in flight simulators.
  - **External Storage**: Devices like NVME drives in USB-C enclosures allow for portable file storage.
  - **Sound Devices**: Includes microphones for communication and speakers for audio output; these peripherals connect via USB.

- In Windows, you can access the sound settings to manage peripheral devices:
  - Select output devices (e.g., speakers or headsets) and adjust volume, stereo, or mono settings.
  - Change input settings like microphone type and levels, and control which applications have access to the microphone.
  - Advanced settings allow adjusting system and program sound volumes.

- A common issue is the "USB controller resource warning," indicating too many devices on high-speed ports. Solutions include rearranging devices or rebooting the system.

By understanding and managing these peripherals, configuring your system becomes easy and customizable, enhancing your overall computing experience.
