In today's world, much of our communication happens remotely, using tools like video conferencing software to connect, share files, exchange ideas, and stay in touch. This video compares two popular platforms: Zoom and Teams. A key advantage of Teams is its default inclusion in Windows 11, making setup straightforward. For example, I used Teams to call my friend Mike Smyer to discuss parts for a new PC build. We chatted seamlessly, adjusted video settings, and explored background effects—an easy feature in both Teams and Zoom.

Screen sharing is another vital function. After sharing my screen with Mike, I sought his approval on the PC build, which included high-performance components like the i9-12900K processor and DDR5 RAM. He confirmed the build looked promising, and I planned to get further approval from Shannon.

This illustrates how video conferencing and screen sharing can facilitate collaboration on projects, regardless of location. As technology continues to evolve, these tools are essential for PC technicians and anyone needing to connect and collaborate remotely.
