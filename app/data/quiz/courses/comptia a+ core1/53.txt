- In today's world of highly specified PCs, you'll eventually need to install and troubleshoot expansion cards. Let's explore modern expansion card formats and address common issues. 

- My first PCI sound card didn't require jumpers or switches, unlike earlier tech. PCI, or Peripheral Component Interconnect, was the first plug-and-play expansion option. However, PCI slots differ from PCI Express (PCIe) slots, which are not backward compatible.

- PCI Express is the updated standard, providing high bandwidth communication between the device and the motherboard. It's popular for GPUs, but it also supports sound, network interface, and RAID cards. 

- PCIe slots come in various sizes: x1, x4, x8, and x16, similar to lanes on a highway—the more lanes, the more bandwidth. An x16 slot performs better than an x1. On this motherboard, we have x1 and x16 slots. We'll install the GPU in the x16 slot.

- Notice the lever for removing the GPU if troubleshooting or removal is required. Slide the GPU into the PCIe slot, ensuring it clicks into place.

- If there’s no signal, follow CompTIA troubleshooting steps. The GPU needs to be plugged into the PCIe slot and have power. Ensure the power connection from the PSU is secure.

- Once the GPU is reseated and powered, test the system. If there's still no signal, check if onboard video is enabled in the BIOS and disable it to use the new GPU fully.
