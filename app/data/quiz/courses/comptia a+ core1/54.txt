- Monitors are essential devices that display the output from your computer. They work by creating images using tiny elements called pixels. 
- Pixels are composed of three components that emit red, green, and blue (RGB) light. This combination allows the display of various colors.
- LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology is common in monitors. It uses liquid crystals that control light passage by turning opaque or clear with electrical charges.
- LCDs need backlighting to function because they do not emit light themselves. Early LCDs used CCFL backlights, but now LEDs are more common.
- By controlling which RGB components allow light to pass, different colors are produced. This is how the RGB color values are created.
- Various LCD panel technologies exist, such as TN (Twisted Nematic) and IPS (In-Plane Switching). TN panels are affordable and fast, while IPS panels offer wide viewing angles.
- Resolution is a key feature of monitors, indicating the number of pixels across the display. Common resolutions include 1280x1024 or 1920x1080.
- Brightness is measured in nits, with typical brightness for panels ranging from 200 to 500 nits.
- Response time, crucial for motion display, measures how quickly a pixel can change from black to white and back. Modern monitors have response times of 1 to 4 milliseconds.
- While "LED monitors" is a common term, it often refers to LCD monitors with LED backlighting, as LCD technology still dominates the market.
- OLED (Organic LED) technology offers ultra-thin displays and potentially flexible screens, making it popular for smart devices.
- DLP (Digital Light Processing) uses a grid of tiny mirrors to manipulate light and create images. It's not common for monitors but used in projectors.
- Understanding these different technologies can help in selecting the right monitor for your needs.
