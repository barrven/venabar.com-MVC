- Today, we're exploring the internal components of an LCD monitor, which I've opened to show its key parts.

- The most crucial component is the LCD screen itself. It's filled with millions of tiny wires and picture elements that display images. Without power, you can't see through it perfectly, but some light may still be visible.

- The white parts surrounding the screen are reflectors. They ensure light is distributed evenly across the monitor to prevent dark and bright spots. The light comes from long, fluorescent tubes called CCFLs located beneath these reflectors.

- The monitor has a power connection and inputs that connect to the video card. It includes an AC to DC power supply, which converts electricity to a usable form for the monitor's circuitry.

- Older CCFLs require AC power, so an inverter is needed to convert the DC power back into AC specifically for these lights. Modern LED panels don't use inverters since they don't require CCFLs.

- Understanding an LCD's setup is vital: it includes the panel, a separate backlight unit, potential inverters for CCFLs, and connectors for data and power.
