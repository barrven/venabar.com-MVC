- Computer technicians often showcase their expertise by discussing monitor resolutions, which are measured in pixels and enhance image clarity.

- Early monitors used a 4:3 aspect ratio, similar to old televisions. Key resolutions include:
  - **VGA**: 640x480, one of the first graphics monitors.
  - **SVGA**: 800x600, commonly used when Windows has video card issues.
  - **SXGA**: 1280x1024, technically 5:4 but grouped with 4:3 resolutions.
  - **UXGA**: 1600x1200, one of the highest 4:3 resolutions.

- The 16:10 aspect ratio gained popularity due to its alignment with the "golden ratio," an aesthetically pleasing mathematical ratio. Notable resolutions include:
  - **WSXGA**: 1440x900, common in laptops.
  - **WUXGA**: 1920x1200, prevalent before HDTV.

- HDTV introduced new resolutions:
  - **720p**: Known for progressive scanning, with a common resolution of 1366x768.
  - **QHD/WQHD**: 2560x1440, popular among gamers.

- **1080p**: A standard HDTV resolution, 1920x1080, widely used in monitors.

- **4k and 5k Resolutions**:
  - **4k**: 3840x2160, equivalent to four HDTV screens in one.
  - **5k**: 5120x2880, often used by Mac users.

- Focus on these key resolutions for the A+ exam, as they represent widely recognized standards and advancements in display technology.
