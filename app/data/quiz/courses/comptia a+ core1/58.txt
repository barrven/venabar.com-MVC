- Start installing the high-end graphics card into your system. First, examine the card's connectors. Many cards default to using one connector, so research or consult the manual to confirm.

- Handle the card by its edges to avoid anti-static issues. Locate the PCIe slots in your system; typically, these are labeled PCIe 1, PCIe 2, and PCIe 3.

- Carefully insert the card into the designated PCIe slot after removing any spacers. Ensure it’s aligned properly and secure it with screws. This is crucial to prevent damage, particularly when positioning the system horizontally.

- Connect the dual eight-pin PCIe power connectors to the card as required by high-end models.

- Within the system BIOS, select the desired graphics card for boot purposes. Options typically include the onboard graphics card (IGFX) or one of the PCIe slots.

- If using multiple graphics cards, riser cards may be necessary. These allow additional cards to be installed via sideways slots, extending your system’s capabilities.

- Once the card is installed, boot the system and verify its functionality in the Device Manager. Look for any warnings indicating issues.

- Confirm the graphics card can support your monitor's native resolution. For example, a 4K monitor requires a card capable of handling 3840 x 2160 resolution.

- Adjust the display settings as needed for readability, such as scaling text to 150% on a 4K monitor.

- Update your drivers for optimal performance. While Windows Update handles driver updates adequately, visiting the manufacturer's website for the latest drivers is a good practice.

- Utilize any utility provided by the video card manufacturer for additional settings and updates, ensuring your system runs efficiently.
