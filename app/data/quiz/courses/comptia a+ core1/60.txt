- I love my old projector, which I've used for about seven years, despite its age. We've done hundreds of presentations together. In this episode, I want to discuss projectors. At their core, projectors are like monitors; they connect to graphics cards via HDMI or VGA and project images onto screens.

- Modern projectors primarily use two technologies: DLP and LCD. Although there are other technologies, they are less common or outdated. Light source is a major factor in projectors, often using traditional bulbs or LEDs. Projectors are rated by brightness, measured in lumens. In dim environments, 1,000 to 1,200 lumens work well, while brighter spaces may require 2,500 lumens or more.

- LED projectors are preferred for their long-lasting bulbs, as replacement bulbs can be expensive. Another key feature is the throw distance, which affects the screen size based on the projector's distance from the screen. Each projector has a recommended minimum and maximum throw distance. Some models offer adjustability and replaceable lenses for flexible setups.

- Geometric adjustments are crucial for correcting image shapes such as pincushion, keystone, and skew. These adjustments help align the image properly on the screen, whether projected onto a wall or ceiling. Setting up a projector can require extensive adjustments, sometimes taking 30 to 40 minutes for perfection.

- Key takeaways: Choose a projector with a long-lasting bulb, ideally LED. Understand the throw distance and ensure it fits your space. Be prepared to make geometric adjustments during installation for the best viewing experience.
