- We live in a tech-driven world where smartphones provide endless information and desktops allow real-time gaming with others. However, understanding networking at a deep level is essential, especially for passing the CompTIA A+ certification and succeeding as a technician. Let's simplify networking by going back to the basics.

- In the past, networks connected a few computers in the same office, sharing resources like printers and folders. This simple setup is known as a Local Area Network (LAN).

- In a LAN, each computer connects to a central hub, which today could be a Wireless Access Point for wireless networks. Two critical issues in this setup were preventing network hogging and ensuring data reached the correct computer.

- To address these, Ethernet was developed in the late 1970s. It remains the most popular networking technology, defining cabling, hubs, speeds, and data chunks called frames limited to 1,500 bytes each.

- To uniquely identify each computer on a network, a Media Access Control (MAC) address is used. A MAC address is a 48-bit identifier shown as 12 hexadecimal characters.

- Each network card globally has a unique MAC address. The first six characters are an OEM ID, assigned for manufacturing. You can view the MAC address on a Windows system by typing "ipconfig /all" in the command prompt; on Mac/Linux, use the command "ifconfig."

- In Ethernet frames, besides data, the destination and source MAC addresses are included, enabling correct data delivery. A Frame Check Sequence (FCS) ensures data integrity upon reaching its destination.

- Basic ethernet frames are still used in today's fastest networks. Although IP addresses are widely discussed, they become more relevant when expanding networks into a Wide Area Network (WAN).
