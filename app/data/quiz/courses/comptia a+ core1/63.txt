- The little boxes used to connect devices and form a local area network are either switches or hubs. Some have five connections, others more, but their primary function remains the same: plugging network cables into any port connects all computers to the network.

- There are key differences between the two technologies: switches and hubs. A hub, which is on top in the given setup, simply repeats incoming signals and broadcasts them to all connected devices. This means if computer D sends data to computer A, all devices receive it, but disregard it if it's not addressed to them.

- The hub's limitation is that all connected devices share the same bandwidth. For example, if A and B are communicating and C and D are also communicating, they share the 10 megabits per second bandwidth, reducing the speed to 5 megabits per conversation.

- A switch, on the other hand, learns the MAC addresses of all connected devices. When it receives a frame, it checks the destination MAC address, creates a direct connection between the sender and recipient, and allows simultaneous, full-speed conversations. Thus, A and B can talk at 10 megabits per second, as can C and D, without interfering with each other.

- In modern local area networks, a switch is preferred over a hub due to its efficient traffic management and full bandwidth utilization capabilities.
