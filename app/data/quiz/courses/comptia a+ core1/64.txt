- Computers use binary code, which consists of 1s and 0s, for processing and storage. In computing, we often talk about bits in various widths, such as 8, 16, 32, and 64 bits, all of which are divisible by four.

- To simplify handling long binary strings, we use a system called hexadecimal, or base 16. Hexadecimal is more manageable because it condenses four binary digits (bits) into a single digit.

- Hexadecimal uses the numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F, where:
  - 0 represents 0000 in binary,
  - 1 represents 0001, 
  - A represents 1010, 
  - F represents 1111, and so forth.

- Hexadecimal values end with an 'h' (e.g., "0h") to indicate they are in base 16.

- Hexadecimal is useful for condensing large binary numbers. For example, a binary value like 11011101 is represented as DDh in hexadecimal.

- A MAC (Media Access Control) address is typically displayed in hexadecimal. It consists of 12 characters, each representing four binary bits; thus, it totals 48 bits (4 x 12).

- This system helps humans read and communicate binary values more efficiently, reducing the length of binary strings by a factor of four.
