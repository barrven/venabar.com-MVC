- You have a 24-port switch, used in a network setup called Ethernet, which is widely used for connecting computers in a Local Area Network (LAN). Though Ethernet can support up to 1,024 computers on interconnected switches, practical network sizes are usually 30 to 40 computers to avoid overloading.

- To create larger networks that connect millions of devices, such as the internet, Ethernet alone is insufficient. Instead, networks are broken into smaller LANs, each with unique identifiers that allow communication through a network called a Wide Area Network (WAN). 

- In a LAN, a switch is used to connect devices using MAC (physical) addresses. When multiple LANs need to communicate, routers are used to manage traffic between them. Routers use logical addressing, known as IP addressing, to identify and route data between different networks.

- Each device in a LAN is assigned a unique IP address, such as 192.168.4.100, where the first three numbers are common for all devices in the LAN, and the last number is unique. The router in the LAN, often assigned .1 as its address, is the default gateway, managing traffic in and out of the network.

- Home networks typically have devices like laptops and smartphones connected through a wireless router, which may include a built-in switch. These routers often come with a DHCP server, automatically assigning IP addresses to devices, simplifying the setup process. 

- The core lesson is that every computer has two addresses: a MAC address for local connections and an IP address for broader network communication.
