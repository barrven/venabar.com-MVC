- Wired connections form the backbone of internet networking, despite the rise of wireless technology. This guide explores various network cables and connectors, focusing mainly on Ethernet, which sets the standard for network frames, cards, cabling, and connectors.

- **Ethernet Standards:** 
  - Examples include 10BASE-T (10 Mbps, twisted pair) and 10GBASE-T (10 Gbps).
  - Different speeds require specific cables, often in copper or fiber optic forms.

- **Coaxial Cables:**
  - Types include RG-58, RG-59, and RG-6, commonly used in video and networking.
  - Connectors: F-type (threaded) and BNC (push and twist).

- **Twisted Pair Cables:**
  - **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP):** Most common, with four twisted pairs, optimal up to 100 meters.
  - **Connectors:** RJ-11 (telephone, 4 contacts) and RJ-45 (network, 8 contacts).
  - **Shielded Twisted Pair (STP):** Offers protection against interference.

- **Fiber Optic Cables:**
  - Employs light, not electricity, suitable for high-speed networks like 10Gb Ethernet.
  - Composed of protective Kevlar, cladding, and a fiber glass core.
  - Types: Multimode (LEDs) and Singlemode (lasers for long distances).
  - Connections usually require pairs for send and receive.

- **CAT Ratings:** 
  - Define UTP capacity: CAT 5 (100 Mbps), CAT 5e (now 1 Gbps), CAT 6 (1 Gbps to 100m, 10 Gbps to 55m), and CAT 6a (10 Gbps to 100m).

- **Plenum Ratings:** 
  - Ratings determine a cable's fire resistance.
  - Types: PVC (basic, flammable), Riser (better fire resistance for vertical runs), and Plenum (highest fire resistance for ceiling and floor spaces).

- **Direct Buried Cables:**
  - Designed for outdoor use, with enhanced insulation and waterproofing for durability against soil conditions and weather.

Understanding these elements is critical for network setups and exams focused on networking.
