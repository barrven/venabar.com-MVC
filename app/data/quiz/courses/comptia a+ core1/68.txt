**Structured Cabling Overview**

- **Structured Cabling Basics**: To improve network organization and safety, cables should be integrated into walls rather than strewn across floors. This method, known as structured cabling, ensures cables are organized and safe, allowing easy connections when needed.

- **Main Distribution Frame (MDF)**: Structured cabling typically starts in a closet or room called the main distribution frame. Here, a standard 19-inch equipment rack is used, with standard heights measured in units (U), like a switch that might be one U high.

- **Horizontal Runs**: From the equipment rack, horizontal runs extend to wall outlets throughout a network. These runs connect through a patch panel, which helps organize and connect cables within the network.

- **Patch Cables and Panels**: Patch cables connect devices to the network via patch panels. These cables often feature a protective cover called a boot. The cables are plugged into the wall outlet on one end and the computer on the other.

- **Maximum Cable Length**: According to TIA standards, horizontal runs shouldn't exceed 90 meters to accommodate patch cables without surpassing the Ethernet limit of 100 meters.

- **110 Punch-Down Tool**: Used to secure wires to the patch panel, ensuring correct 568 A or B configurations. Each patch panel might have different wiring patterns based on the manufacturer.

- **Cable Testing**: Testing the connection involves continuity and wire map tests. For cable location, tools like the "fox and the hound" help track cables through a tone generation system.

- **Advanced Testing**: A time domain reflectometer (TDR) can measure cable length by using the speed of light, identifying potential breaks.

- **Cable Types**: Solid core cables, suitable for wall installations, use a solid copper piece for each wire. Stranded cables, used for patch cables, offer flexibility and durability, with each wire composed of multiple strands.

- **Loopback Plugs**: Used for testing port functionality by reversing output and input signals. These devices are available for both copper and fiber connections.

By organizing networks with structured cabling, implementing proper testing, and using the appropriate tools and techniques, networks can achieve higher efficiency and reliability.
