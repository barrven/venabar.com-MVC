To connect a computer to a network, it needs a network interface card (NIC). Traditionally, NICs were separate cards inserted into computers, featuring an RJ-45 connector for connectivity. Today, most devices have built-in NICs in their motherboards, including laptops.

**Key Points:**

1. **Network Interface Cards (NIC):**
   - Earlier NICs were separate cards with an RJ-45 connector.
   - Modern computers typically have integrated NICs as part of the motherboard.

2. **Configuration and Settings:**
   - NICs appear under 'Network Adapters' in the Device Manager.
   - A down arrow signifies a NIC is disabled, and it can be enabled if needed.
   - Important basic setting includes speed and duplex mode, usually set to "auto negotiation."

3. **Speed and Duplex:**
   - Full duplex allows simultaneous sending and receiving of data.
   - Half duplex might be used in specific situations, like using a crossover cable.

4. **Wake-on-LAN:**
   - Allows computers to wake up from a powered-off state when a "magic packet" is received.
   - Useful for administrators to perform updates on networks where devices are turned off.

5. **Link Lights:**
   - Indicate network connectivity and activity.
   - Types include link light (steady), speed light (color varies by speed), and activity light (flashing).
   - It's essential to verify link lights on both the NIC and the network switch to ensure full connectivity.

6. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Ensure that NICs are enabled and drivers are correctly installed.
   - Always check link lights on both the device and the network switch for accurate connectivity diagnostics.

In summary, understanding NICs and their configurations in Device Manager, along with wake-on-LAN features and link lights, are crucial for effective network management and troubleshooting.
