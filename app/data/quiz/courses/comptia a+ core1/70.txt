- IP Addresses are essential for internet communication. They allow information to reach computers worldwide and come in a typical format like 192.168.5.10, which consists of four numbers separated by three dots.

- The internet's development began in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the United States, aiming to connect thousands of local area networks (LANs), including military and university networks, via a system that would become known as the internet.

- ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, was tasked with creating a reliable connection system. This early system required a numbering scheme—a precursor to the IP address—to manage connections and reroute information if nodes failed.

- Initially, there was an estimate of 10,000 to 20,000 computers being connected, leading to the creation of IP addresses made up of four octets, each ranging from 0 to 255, creating about 4 billion possible addresses.

- These IP addresses serve two purposes: identifying the network a device is part of and providing a unique host ID to each device on that network.

- Networks were organized with routers, such as a "10 router" for one area and a "12 router" for another, and numbers were often chosen arbitrary by computer enthusiasts of the time.

- Using Rice University as an example, the numbering allowed further distribution within the community. For instance, the University of Houston might use "12.1" as their network, sub-dividing further for internal use, such as "12.1.44" for parallel processing.

- Class system: IP addresses are organized into classes based on the network's needs:
  - Class A: One locked number, with millions of possible devices.
  - Class B: Two locked numbers, facilitating thousands of devices.
  - Class C: Three locked numbers, accommodating up to 254 devices.

- No two devices on the internet can share an IP address; the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocates these addresses.

- The format of an IP address is four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. Valid addresses must not end in 0 or 255 due to network identification rules.

- Each computer requires an IP address, a subnet mask, and a default gateway to communicate over the internet:
  - The subnet mask, typically 255.255.255.0, helps determine if the destination IP is within the same network.
  - The default gateway is the router address that acts as an access point to other networks or the internet if the destination is not local.

- Understanding IP addresses' structure and function is crucial for navigating and maintaining network systems, with further details to be covered in subsequent discussions.
