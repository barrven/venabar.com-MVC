- The internet has used IPv4 addresses for decades. An IPv4 address consists of four numbers between 1 and 254, separated by dots. These addresses were sufficient until the number of devices exceeded the available 4 billion addresses.

- To address the shortage, IPv6 was introduced. An IPv6 address has eight groups of numbers separated by colons, significantly increasing the number of available addresses. To visualize, IPv6 provides as many addresses as there are molecules in a fraction of Earth's air, ensuring we won't run out soon.

- IPv6 not only expands address availability but also removes outdated features of IPv4. A key aspect of IPv6 is its shorthand writing form, where leading zeros are removed, and consecutive zeros can be replaced with double colons.

- Unlike IPv4, where a device has one IP address, an IPv6-enabled device has at least two: a link-local address and a global unicast address. The link-local address starts with "fe80:" and is generated automatically. The global unicast address is provided by the router and is used for internet communication.

- IPv6 addresses may include temporary addresses for enhanced security, allowing safer connections to multiple servers. It's crucial to recognize the format of IPv4 versus IPv6 addresses, particularly for exams.

- In IPv4, a subnet mask helps determine local versus long-distance network communication. In IPv6, this function is replaced by a prefix, usually "/64", simplifying data routing to the appropriate destinations efficiently.
