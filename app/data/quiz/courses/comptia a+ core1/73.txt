- The internet is used to access information, requiring a client program, like a web browser, to connect to a server that hosts the data. 
- When using a web browser, like Chrome or Firefox, to visit a website (e.g., www.totalsem.com), you're connecting to a server running specific software (e.g., IIS or Apache) that delivers the requested web pages.
- This client-server communication is fundamental to internet operations, including web browsing and online gaming, where your client connects to a server hosting game data.
- Every server has an IP address, and domain names (e.g., www.totalsem.com) use the Domain Name System (DNS) to resolve into these IP addresses.
- When you make a request to a server, your computer sends a packet with its own IP address and the server's IP address, along with data detailing the request, such as asking for a web page.
- Computers manage multiple tasks at once, like running different web pages or applications, requiring something beyond an IP address to differentiate between tasks—this is where port numbers come in.
- Port numbers range from 0 to 65535 and designate specific applications on a device. For instance, HTTP uses port 80, and HTTPS uses port 443.
- When a data packet reaches a server, the server directs it to the correct application based on the port number in the request.
- Your computer can handle numerous connections simultaneously, each designated through unique port numbers, which allows for multiple web pages and applications to run concurrently.
- Windows Resource Monitor helps you view all active connections by showing local and remote IP addresses and port numbers.
- Web pages often establish multiple connections due to ads, JavaScript, and other embedded elements.
- There are three types of port numbers:
  - Well-known ports (0-1023) for common applications like web services.
  - Registered ports (1024-49151) for applications registered with the internet's governing bodies.
  - Ephemeral ports (49152-65535) are dynamically assigned for temporary connections.
- For certifications like A Plus, you should memorize specific port numbers, as they are crucial for understanding network operations.
- Remember, IP addresses direct data to the correct computer, while port numbers ensure it reaches the right application on that computer.
