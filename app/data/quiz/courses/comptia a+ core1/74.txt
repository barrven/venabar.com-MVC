To understand how the internet works, it's essential to know how different software and hardware communicate effectively. This communication relies on protocols, which are sets of rules enabling various systems to work together. For example, different devices like Windows PCs, Macs, and cameras can use IP addressing because they follow the IP protocol. This protocol identifies devices on a network, but much more is needed to transfer data.

The most common protocol used on the internet is TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), which combines two protocols to facilitate data exchange. TCP is a connection-based protocol, like a conversation with an ice cream shop owner where you initiate contact and ensure the other party is ready before placing an order. It is used for most internet activities like web browsing and video calls because it ensures reliable communication.

UDP, another protocol, is connectionless. It works like walking into an ice cream shop and ordering directly, assuming the server is prepared without prior interaction. UDP is used when speed is prioritized over reliability, such as in live broadcasts.

ICMP is a third protocol that operates with single packets, such as sending a ping to check connectivity. Unlike TCP and UDP, ICMP sends one packet at a time, making it unique.

In network communication, separating protocols involves analyzing different layers comprising frames, packets, and data. A Protocol Data Unit (PDU) identifies these layers. For instance, when examining network switches, focus on MAC addresses within an Ethernet frame. Above that is the IP packet, and at the top level are TCP segments or UDP datagrams within data packets.

Understanding these PDUs helps differentiate the components of network data and choose the right protocol depending on the context and requirements.
