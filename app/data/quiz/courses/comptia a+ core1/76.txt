- To use DNS on your systems, you must set it up. DNS is generally provided by your DHCP server, so if you use DHCP, you likely already have a DNS server configured.

- You can check your current DNS settings by running `ipconfig /all` on your system. This will display your DNS server, which might be a local server within your network.

- While DHCP makes configuring DNS straightforward, you might want to set it manually. To do so, go to your network settings: 
  1. Open the Network and Sharing Center.
  2. Select "Change adapter settings."
  3. Right-click on your network adapter and choose "Properties."
  4. Select IPv4, then click "Properties."
  5. You can opt to "Obtain DNS server address automatically" or enter a preferred DNS server manually.

- Manually configuring DNS can be useful if DNS problems occur. For example, entering a public DNS server like Google's (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) can help troubleshoot issues when your local DNS server fails.

- To identify DNS issues, use the NSLookup tool. It verifies whether a DNS server is functional:
  - Run `NSLookup` to enter interactive mode.
  - It shows your current DNS server and lets you check the server’s functionality.
  
- You can change the DNS server in NSLookup to test different servers. If you receive no errors, the server is functional. On the other hand, persistent timeouts indicate that the DNS server is down.

- For the A+ exam and real-world troubleshooting, recognize DNS issues by understanding response errors and timeouts. Use alternative DNS servers or contact an administrator if problems persist.
