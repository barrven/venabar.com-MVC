- When setting up a home router, it's crucial to manage its security and configuration. Simply plugging it in may grant Internet access, but this can expose vulnerabilities.

- Your router's status screen indicates Internet availability. The WAN connection is key here, typically set to Dynamic IP using DHCP, though some ISPs require Static IP.

- On the LAN side, it's beneficial to change the default network ID. For example, setting the router to 10.11.12.1 and adjusting the DHCP server range can enhance network management.

- Beware when changing the LAN side; if devices are set statically, reconnections may require manual IP adjustments.

- Home routers often offer guided setup options, including password changes and wireless settings in Quick or Advanced setup modes.

- DHCP settings are vital. You can define IP ranges and adjust lease times based on your network's needs. DHCP reservations can fix IPs for specific devices, though it's often easier to set these outside the pool range.

- Administrative tools are essential early on. Time settings should use NTP servers for accuracy. Regularly check for firmware updates to ensure stability and security.

- Secure your router's administration by setting strong passwords and limiting who can access settings. Local management can limit access to specific devices, while remote management should generally be avoided to protect against unauthorized access.

- Overall, hands-on management is preferable, accessing settings from the LAN to safeguard your network.
