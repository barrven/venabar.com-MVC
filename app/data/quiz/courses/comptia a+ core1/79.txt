- You need to connect voice over IP (VoIP) phones to your network, but you want them separated from the computers. You have two connections at each workstation, all running to your main distribution frame.  
- Instead of buying another switch to create separate networks, you can use VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks). VLANs allow one physical switch to act as two or more switches, keeping devices on separate networks without extra hardware.  
- To configure a VLAN, you need a managed switch, which is different from an unmanaged switch due to its configuration interface and features like VLANs. Managed switches are more expensive but offer advanced options.  
- First, assign an IP address to the switch to access and configure it, even though switches use MAC addresses for regular operations. This allows you to manage the switch as a managed device.  
- Locate the switch's IP address by connecting it to a DHCP-enabled router, then use a web browser to access its management interface.  
- VLANs are numbered (e.g., VLAN 1, VLAN 2). By default, VLAN 1 includes all switch ports. You can assign specific ports to VLAN 2 to ensure your VoIP phones operate on a separate network.  
- VLANs effectively separate network traffic, making devices on different VLANs unable to communicate as though on different physical switches.  
- Besides VLANs, managed switches often have port security features, which can restrict access based on MAC addresses. This feature keeps unknown devices from connecting and alerts you to unauthorized connections.  
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another network technology that separates the control plane from the data plane, allowing central management of network devices. SDN reduces manual configuration errors and provides scalable network solutions. It's increasingly popular and worth exploring for its innovative approach to network management.
