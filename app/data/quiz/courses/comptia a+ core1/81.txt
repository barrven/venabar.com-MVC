- We live in a world dominated by wireless technology, guided by the IEEE 802.11 standard, commonly known as Wi-Fi. This standard, around for 20 years, governs how wireless devices communicate.

- There are many versions of 802.11, such as 802.11B, G, and AC, but fundamentally, they all rely on wireless access points (WAPs). These act as bridges between Ethernet networks and wireless networks.

- Home routers are multifunctional devices that include a router, a switch, and a WAP. Many devices might be called WAPs, but true WAPs typically only have one Ethernet connection.

- Wireless networks operate in two modes: 
  - **Infrastructure mode** requires WAPs to connect devices to the network. This is the most common setup in offices, schools, and public places.
  - **Ad hoc mode** doesn’t use a WAP. Instead, devices with wireless network cards (NICs) connect directly to each other. This mode is less common but useful in specific scenarios, like temporary networks.

- Wireless network cards (NICs) can be found in various forms such as built-in cards in motherboards, USB adapters, and in all modern laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

- Wireless communication relies heavily on antennas, which come in various types:
  - **Omnidirectional antennas** emit signals in all directions, creating a ball-shaped coverage area.
  - **Dipole antennas** emit signals in a flattened, donut-like shape, useful for horizontal coverage.
  - **Patch antennas** direct signals forward, useful when placed against walls.
  - **Highly directional antennas,** like Yagi and parabolic types, focus signals over long distances.

- Understanding these basics of 802.11 networks, WAPs, NICs, and antenna types helps ensure effective wireless communication and setup.
