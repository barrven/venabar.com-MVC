- The 802.11 standard, though old, is frequently updated to enhance speed and system support. The original version offered a speed of about one megabit per second, but practical extensions like 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g have increased capacities over time.

- The 802.11 standard operates on unlicensed ISM bands, primarily using the 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz frequency ranges. A "band" is a spectrum of radio frequencies which prevents signal interference among various wireless access points.

- The 2.4 gigahertz band spans 2.412 to 2.84 gigahertz, offering up to 14 channels in Japan, 13 in Europe, and 11 in the U.S. The 5 gigahertz band ranges from 5.15 to 5.875 gigahertz, with complex channel arrangements numbered from 36 to 165.

- Key extensions of the 802.11 standard:
  - **802.11a**: Early extension, delivering 54 megabits per second on the 5 gigahertz band.
  - **802.11b**: Concurrent with 802.11a, offering 11 megabits per second on the 2.4 gigahertz band.
  - **802.11g**: Merges benefits of a and b, running at 54 megabits per second on the 2.4 gigahertz band and is backward compatible with 802.11b, but not with 802.11a.
  - **802.11n**: Operates on both bands, supports backward compatibility with a, b, and g standards, and introduces MIMO to optimize signal focus.
  - **802.11ac**: Provides high speeds with advanced MU-MIMO, allowing simultaneous focus on multiple clients. It typically includes backward compatibility with 2.4 gigahertz, although it's not part of the ac standard itself.
  
- The Wi-Fi Alliance introduced simplified names for these extensions, like Wi-Fi 4 for 802.11n and Wi-Fi 5 for 802.11ac, for easier consumer understanding. To benefit from ac speeds, devices must have 802.11ac-compatible hardware. Upgrading network interface cards (NICs) in desktops or laptops is often necessary to utilize newer standards.

Understanding these extensions is crucial, especially when preparing for the A+ exam which emphasizes familiarity with these specifications.
