- Small offices and home offices often don't need a full-blown infrastructure network, which can be complex and require technical skills for setup, especially when dealing with wireless access points and encryption.

- A simpler alternative is a Wireless Mesh Network. This setup is easy and doesn't require much technical knowledge. It involves a base station connected to your main network, like a cable modem, and additional stations for extended coverage.

- To set up, you configure a single SSID and place extra stations strategically around your space for optimal coverage. These stations, or "Beacons," can simply be plugged into a power source wherever better network access is needed.

- The network is managed through an app, which simplifies monitoring and additional setups. Advanced encryption is built-in and requires no extra configuration, simplifying the process to just setting an SSID and password.

- Although mesh networks don't match the throughput of complex infrastructure networks, they offer sufficient performance for small offices and homes, thanks to their easy configuration and robust built-in security.
