Setting up a wireless network in an enterprise environment involves similar elements as in a small office or home office, such as using SSIDs and encryption standards like WPA2. However, enterprise setups are larger and often use dedicated Wireless Access Points (WAPs), rather than routers or switches. These WAPs are usually powered via Power over Ethernet (PoE), eliminating the need for separate power adapters. PoE and PoE+ switches supply both data and electricity to these devices, with PoE+ being more common due to its higher power capacity.

In enterprise environments, strategic placement of WAPs is crucial. Tools like heat maps help visualize coverage and identify dead zones. This process often requires professional help and specialized, costly analysis tools. Enterprise networks also require robust security measures such as AAA (Authorization, Authentication, and Accounting), often utilizing systems like Radius or TACACS+ for authentication beyond simple pre-shared keys.

Configuration of WAPs in an enterprise involves setting up uniform SSIDs across multiple access points, creating an Extended SSID (ESSID) for seamless connectivity as users move throughout the coverage area. Features such as wireless isolation can restrict inter-device communication on the network, which is useful in public spaces. Rogue AP detection helps prevent unauthorized devices from joining the network.

Managing an entire setup manually can be cumbersome, so enterprise solutions often use wireless LAN switches to centralize configuration tasks like setting ESSIDs and captive portals. These switches are designed specifically to work with WAPs and, while they are an investment, they streamline network management significantly.

Overall, enterprise wireless networks are characterized by the need for extensive planning, strategic placement of access points, advanced authentication protocols, and tools for efficient management, differentiating them from simpler home or small office networks.
