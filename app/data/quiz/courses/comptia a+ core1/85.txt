- **802.11** is the most common form of wireless technology we use today, but other technologies like **RFID (Radio Frequency Identification)** and **Bluetooth** are also important.

- **RFID**:
  - Commonly used in industries such as warehousing for inventory management.
  - Consists of a tiny sticker that acts as a radio and can store a small amount of data.
  - Readers use radio frequency energy to power these stickers, allowing them to transmit data back.
  - Often used in **Near-Field Communication (NFC)**, such as tap-to-pay systems on smartphones.

- **Bluetooth**:
  - Similar to 802.11 but designed for connecting two devices at a time in a **Personal Area Network (PAN)**.
  - Comes in three classes, affecting the signal range: 
      - Class 1: Up to 100 meters
      - Class 2: Up to 10 meters
      - Class 3: Less than 10 meters
  - Used for connecting devices like headphones, keyboards, and car systems.
  - Pairing involves making devices discoverable and often requires a four-digit PIN, though newer devices may not need this.

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - RFID is mostly used in industry settings and for NFC in consumer devices.
  - Bluetooth is widely used for personal device connections and requires pairing.
