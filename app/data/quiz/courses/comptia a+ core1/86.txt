- Mike Stromi discusses common wireless network errors and solutions, as outlined in A+ material.

- **Key Tool**: Use a Wi-Fi analyzer. Smartphones with Wi-Fi analysis apps (e.g., WiFi Man for Android) can help identify network visibility issues. If multiple devices cannot see a network, the issue may be with the SSID.

- **No Connectivity**: 
  - Often due to connecting to a non-existing SSID.
  - Solutions: Check if the SSID or passcode has changed by asking the network administrator or venue staff.
  - Low radio frequency signal can also cause issues. 
  - Remedies include moving closer to the access point, checking antenna orientation, and ensuring correct antenna configuration for different frequency bands.

- **SSID Issues**:
  - If an SSID is no longer found, it might have been changed or its broadcast turned off.
  - To connect, manually configure the profile with the correct SSID name, security type (WPA/WPA2), and passcode.

- **Limited Connectivity**:
  - Can arise due to physical obstructions or interference (e.g., walls, baby monitors).
  - Solutions: Identify and remove interference or relocate the access point.

- **Intermittent Connectivity**:
  - May be caused by low RF signals or network congestion.
  - Advanced 802.11 technologies try to overcome these but may fail if too many users are connected.
  - Solutions include adding more access points or configuring Quality of Service (QoS) to manage bandwidth allocation efficiently.

- **Tips**:
  - Monitor wireless networks with analyzers for interference in ISM bands.
  - Consider user capacity and strategically add WAPs to handle high traffic. 
  - Use QoS settings to ensure critical applications have necessary bandwidth.

- These insights are essential for addressing common wireless network errors, crucial for those studying A+ certification objectives.
