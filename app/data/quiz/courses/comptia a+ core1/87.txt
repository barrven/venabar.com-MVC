- **LAN (Local Area Network):** A group of computers connected to a single switch, allowing easy communication. All devices share the same network ID, such as 192.168.4.x. LANs are typically in close physical proximity.

- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Comprises two or more LANs connected through routers, each LAN having a unique network ID. A WAN spans larger geographical areas, possibly connecting multiple towns or regions.

- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** A type of WAN that covers a municipal area, typically confined to a city or town.

- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** A network exclusive to Bluetooth connections, forming a direct link between two Bluetooth-capable devices.

- **Internet:** The largest WAN, connecting multiple LANs, MANs, and WANs globally, forming a worldwide network.

Understanding these network types is essential for IT certifications like CompTIA A+, as they are central topics in networking.
