- The internet is structured in tiers. It consists of interconnected networks rather than a single, vast network.
  
- **Tier 1**: These are major companies providing internet primarily to large customers, covering different sections of the United States. Although they compete fiercely, they must cooperate to enable nationwide coverage through peering agreements, facilitating traffic sharing at network operation centers (NOCs).
  
- **Network Operation Centers (NOCs)**: These are facilities where Tier 1 companies interconnect, housing extensive infrastructure to maintain network reliability. These centers ensure secure and continuous operation.
  
- **Tier 2**: These companies are smaller than Tier 1 but have substantial regional presence. They may have some peering agreements with other networks but generally purchase internet access from Tier 1 providers.
  
- **Tier 3**: Known as internet service providers (ISPs) like Comcast and AT&T, these companies sell internet services to individuals and businesses. They mainly purchase internet connectivity from Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers and have few peering agreements.
  
- Individuals and businesses are at the bottom, reliant on ISPs for internet access. 
  
- This tier system is dynamic, with companies frequently negotiating, litigating, and adjusting their positions within these tiers.
