- **Broadband Connections: Overview**
  - Broadband is the common way to connect to the internet, offering an always-on service unlike dial-up.
  - Common types include DSL, cable, satellite, and specialized wireless (802.11 setups).

- **DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)**
  - One of the earliest broadband types, utilizing telephone lines for digital service.
  - Comes in two forms: asymmetric (slower upload speed compared to download) and symmetric (equal upload and download speeds).
  - Historically slower, but modern DSL can reach 7 Mbps or better.
  - Setup may require PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) for entering ISP-provided login details.

- **Cable Internet**
  - Utilizes a protocol called DOCSIS, similar to Ethernet, allowing internet access without interrupting TV services.
  - Historical speeds were around 1.5 Mbps upload and 10 Mbps download; now, speeds can reach gigabit levels.
  - Custom MAC address settings can aid in setup, especially with personal cable modems replacing rented ones.

- **Satellite Internet**
  - Ideal for rural areas without DSL or cable.
  - Current capabilities: about 3 Mbps upload and 25 Mbps download.
  - Latency can be an issue due to satellite's geosynchronous orbit distance.

- **802.11 Wireless Setups**
  - Special setups involving large antennas connecting to towers, popular in rural regions.
  - Can offer high-speed internet in places without traditional broadband infrastructure.

- **Fiber Internet and ONT (Optical Network Terminal)**
  - Converts light signals (fiber) to electrical signals (copper wiring) for network use.
  - Ensures compatibility with traditional copper-based network equipment.
  - ONT maintenance and troubleshooting could be critical for network exams.

For any broadband connection, key considerations include understanding the setup requirements, such as PPPoE for DSL, MAC cloning for cable modems, and potential latency for satellite connections. These insights help optimize and troubleshoot internet setups effectively.
