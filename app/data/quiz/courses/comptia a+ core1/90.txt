- In the upcoming episodes, we will explore various application protocols, not just web-based ones. While many users primarily use the internet through browsers for activities like checking email, using search engines, or playing games, the web is only a part of the internet.

- We'll delve into other protocols such as SSH, FTP, and email, including web protocols, and focus on understanding what happens during a server connection, particularly regarding ports.

- Servers, like client systems, have firewalls. Many users are familiar with host-based and router firewalls for clients, but it’s important to remember that servers have firewalls too, which can create significant issues if not managed properly.

- Let's break down how data packets move between a client and a server. A client connects to the internet through routers and ISPs, often simplified as a 'cloud'. To access a web page, the client must open a browser, with its host-based firewall permitting outgoing traffic on Port 80, designated for HTTP traffic.

- The client's router also allows outgoing Port 80 traffic, but typically blocks incoming Port 80 traffic for security reasons.

- Servers actively listen for incoming Port 80 traffic, vital for processing web requests. When data returns to the client, the destination and source port numbers swap, enabling data flow through firewalls without obstruction.

- Crucially, a server firewall cannot block incoming Port 80 traffic if the server publishes web services. Public-facing servers will have firewalls that use stateful inspection to block harmful or unauthorized activities.

- At home, routers do not permit incoming Port 80 traffic as there are typically no web servers present. Understanding the difference between incoming and outgoing port traffic is essential, especially for A+ certification topics.

- Servers must have open firewalls on specific ports they serve. Clients focus on outgoing traffic, ensuring incoming ports do not allow unwanted access. This separation underscores the differences between server and client network configurations.
