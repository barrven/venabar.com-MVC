- Email has been a widely used communication tool for a long time. Most people have multiple email accounts—such as Gmail, Office 365, Yahoo, and Proton Mail—and sometimes create throwaway email accounts.

- Configuring email usually involves using an email client or a popular web-based service. These services often auto-configure email settings, but manually configuring email requires understanding specific protocols and settings.

- Three main protocols are used for email configuration: 
  - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**: Used to send emails, typically running on port 25.
  - **POP3 (Post Office Protocol 3)**: Used to retrieve emails, using port 110; it's more basic and requires setting up folders on the client.
  - **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**: Also retrieves emails, on port 143, and keeps email folders and organization in sync across all devices.

- IMAP is generally preferred over POP3 today because it synchronizes folders and message states across devices.

- When setting up email on devices like iPhones:
  - Navigate to 'Settings' > 'Passwords & Accounts' > 'Add Account'.
  - Select 'Other' for manual setup if automatic options aren't available.
  - Enter details like name, email address, and password.
  - Input server information for SMTP (outgoing) and either POP3 or IMAP (incoming)—often the same server like mail.totalhome.com.
  - Ensure correct ports are entered based on whether secure or standard protocols are used.

- Important to know traditional port numbers (SMTP: 25, POP3: 110, IMAP: 143) for exams, but be aware that secure options often use ports like 587.

- Manual email setup requires specific details often provided by a mail administrator, such as server names and port numbers, to ensure proper configuration.
