- Typically, when connecting to a web, SSH, or FTP server, your connection is direct, passing through routers. However, sometimes a proxy server is used. A proxy server acts as an intermediary in your network. 

- For instance, if your network ID is 192.168.4 and your computer is 192.168.4.106, adding another device as a proxy server at 192.168.4.20 can change this setup. Instead of direct connections, your data is routed through the proxy server first.

- Why use a proxy server? It offers several benefits, including filtering content and tracking data to protect privacy. For example, it can block undesired websites and monitor information to prevent the exposure of personal data like social security numbers. Schools often use them to restrict access to harmful sites.

- To configure a proxy server, applications must be set to route traffic through it instead of directly to a router. This configuration is application-specific; for web browsing on Windows, you adjust settings in Internet Options under "Connections" and "LAN settings." You can specify a proxy server’s IP and optionally set exclusions for local addresses.

- Proxy servers provide additional advantages like caching, which speeds up access to frequently visited pages by storing static content. They are sophisticated tools that update in real-time to filter inappropriate content. While they can be expensive, many organizations find their features worth the investment.

- To enforce the use of a proxy server, network administrators can block all direct connections via certain ports, such as port 80 for HTTP, unless routed through the proxy. This ensures compliance with network policies.
