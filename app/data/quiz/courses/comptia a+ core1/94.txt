- Turning on a smart light bulb involves three key technologies. This example highlights the Internet of Things (IoT) and its role in home automation. IoT enables devices that traditionally lacked internet connectivity, such as thermostats, refrigerators, and light bulbs, to be controlled remotely.

- Smart bulbs, for instance, have a microprocessor, a unique address, and an API. Such features allow them to be controlled in various ways, such as changing colors.

- Three primary wireless communication technologies are used to connect these IoT devices:
  1. **802.11 (Wi-Fi):** A common method for IoT device communication.
  2. **Zigbee:** Specifically designed for home automation; operates on the 2.4 GHz band and requires minimal bandwidth.
  3. **Z-Wave:** Operates on the 900 MHz band, which is quieter and ideal for such applications.

- To manage IoT devices, a hub is necessary. Examples include a Philips branded hub for light bulbs and Google Home for various smart devices.

- Configuration might involve using applications on tablets or smartphones to control devices, like turning lamps on and off or adjusting brightness.

- Voice-activated assistants such as Siri can enhance the convenience of using home automation tools, allowing users to control their environment with voice commands.

In summary, smart home technology leverages these three technologies—Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Z-Wave—alongside dedicated hubs and applications, to create an interconnected and efficiently managed home environment.
