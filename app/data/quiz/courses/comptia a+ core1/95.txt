- When facing networking issues, follow these key troubleshooting steps: 

1. **Understand Networking Basics**: Knowledge of network functionality and configurations is essential. 

2. **Check Physical Connections**: Inspect physical network components first. Verify connectivity by checking link lights:
   - On Windows: Lower-right corner 
   - On Linux/Mac: Upper-right corner

3. **Know Your Network Details**: Familiarize yourself with critical network information:
   - Use `ipconfig /all` to find your IPv4/IPv6 addresses, default gateway, DNS, and DHCP server information. 
   - Document your network IDs and main components on paper for quick reference.

4. **Verify Internet Connectivity**: Use `traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows) to trace the path from your device to an external address. Familiarize yourself with normal paths so you can identify issues quickly:
   - Identify the internal routers and the gateway.
   - Recognize routers that don’t respond to `traceroute` by design.

5. **Utilize the Ping Command**: 
   - Ping your router to check device connectivity and verify the router is active.
   - Ping a fully-qualified domain name to ensure your DNS server functions correctly, as a successful IP address return indicates DNS resolution.

6. **Key Tools for Troubleshooting**:
   - `ping`
   - `traceroute`
   - `ipconfig`

These tools address most networking problems and are important for preparedness on network exams. Practice using them to enhance troubleshooting skills.
