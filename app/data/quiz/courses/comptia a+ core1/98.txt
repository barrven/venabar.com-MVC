- Getting a virtual machine running is straightforward if you're familiar with the operating system you're installing. This session explores advanced features and aspects available in most hypervisors.

- Demonstration: On the screen, two virtual machines are running—one with Windows 7 and the other with Windows 10. Unlike Windows 7, where exiting requires a special key, Windows 10 adjusts screen resolution dynamically based on window size.

- VirtualBox's Extension Pack adds useful features, although it's not essential. One limitation when a machine is running is the inability to manipulate features extensively, such as adding or removing a hard drive.

- For virtual machine disk management practice, you can create additional virtual drives. This is a cost-efficient way to prepare for exams like A+, without needing additional hardware.

- Networking in virtual machines can be complex but rewarding. Important concepts include NAT and bridged adapters:
  - **Bridged Network**: Connects the virtual machine to a real network card on the host, making it behave as if it's on the same network.
  - **NAT**: Creates a virtual router that uses the host as an internet service provider, allowing only one virtual machine per virtualized network ID.
  - **NAT Networks**: Allow multiple virtual machines on a simulated network with a virtual router and DHCP server, enabling the setup of separate internal networks.

- Additional networking modes:
  - **Internal Network**: An isolated internal network with no external router.
  - **Host-only Adapter**: Connects directly to the host's network card, typically avoided.
  - **Generic Driver**: Simulates different network cards for compatibility with older operating systems.

- Virtualization enhances learning and preparation for A+ certification in areas like storage and networking without additional hardware.

- When considering cloud computing or building cloud infrastructure, remember security requirements similar to physical devices: proper access control, regular updates, thorough auditing, and reliable recovery options are crucial. These measures ensure secure and efficient cloud operation.
