-: So by now, you're probably wondering

what is the CompTIA A+ exam?

Well, before we get into that,

you need to know who is CompTIA, right?

CompTIA is a vendor-neutral,

nonprofit trade association

that also helps lobby the IT industry

to reform best practices

and generally improve efficiency and standards.

in our industry.

They offer certifications

from basic IT fundamentals to the A+

to networking in Linux and cybersecurity and more.

Now, the A+ exam tests the skills of a tech

with 12 months hands-on experience

in a help desk support technician,

desktop support technician,

or field service technician job role.

And the A+ Certification actually requires you

to pass two exams.

They are known as the Core 1 or 220-1101

and the Core 2 or the 220-1102.

And you can actually find out a lot of information

about CompTIA and not only the A+ certification

but all the certification

and resources that they have to offer

by going to their website, comptia.org.

And here it is,

and you'll see they have a bunch of information

on certification and some other resources.

Also, some of the other certifications they offer here,

like the Network+ and Security+,

the fact that they have online testing available,

which we'll walk through,

and all sorts of other ways to get involved with CompTIA.

The point is,

they are one of the defacto certifying agencies

in information technology,

and you can find everything you need to know about CompTIA

and the A+ exam right here on their website.
