-: Well, in today's day and age, I'm sure you'll agree

with me that a lot of our communication is done remotely.

We use things such as video conferencing

software to talk to each other, exchange files, ideas,

and just stay in touch.

So in this video, I thought it'd be a good idea to go

through possibly the two most prominent platforms

that we have for that type of video conferencing

and that is Zoom and Teams.

The great thing about Teams is

that it's included by default in Windows 11

so it's a super easy setup.

I actually have to call our friend Mike Smyer

because I need to confirm some parts for my PC build.

So let's go ahead and do that.

(Teams ringtone playing)

Steve: Hey Mike, enjoying the beach I see.

How are you?

-: Hey, Steve.

Pretty good. Pretty good.

Steve: Can you hear and see me okay?

-: I can hear you just fine.

Camera's not quite on yet though.

Steve: Oh, my apologies.

I had that disabled.

How about now?

-: There it is.

-: Hey Mike, that...

-: How are you doing?

-: I'm doing great.

Before we get into it,

that's a really cool background you got.

How do you do that?

-: Oh, it's pretty easy.

It's built into Teams

and Zoom and all the new ones now.

But you can just go up and click

on the bar there and click apply background effects.

-: Oh, that is awesome.

-: And you'll have a whole list of them.

-: Oh, that is too cool for school.

I like this one.

I'm going to the Red Rocks.

Perfect.

-: Aw yeah.

-: Awesome, awesome.

-: You're in the southwest.

-: Yeah. Yeah. So, hey,

I just wanted to share my screen real quick

and get your approval on those parts.

-: Uh huh.

-: All right. Let me see.

This build is going to be fantastic.

-: I'm looking forward to it.

You've been talking about it for a while.

Steve: Oh yeah.

So we have the i9-12900K in here.

We've got that Liquid cooling Deepcool in there.

That real nice Asus.

Yeah. You see that.

We've got 32 gigs of that real nice LED RAM in there.

The high speed DDR5.

What do you think?

You think Shannon will approve it?

-: Wow, that's gonna look good on.

That's gonna look great.

Steve: Okay. Alright, good.

Well, again, Mike, I really appreciate your help.

I'm gonna go ahead and give Shannon a call

and see if I can get this approved and you have a great day.

-: Alright, you too as well.

Steve: Thanks, Mike.

-: Have a good day, Steve.

Steve: Bye.

Hey, do you have a quick minute?

I just wanted to screen share

with you real quick and show you the parts list

for my new PC build for my office.

Mike Smyer already approved it.

Alright, can I share my screen

with you real quick and get your stamp of approval

on these list of parts for my new PC for my office?

-: Yeah, let's see the new build.

-: Aw, awesome. I'm so excited.

Here it is.

So slightly over budget, but I hope

the powers that be won't mind.

It's for an important cause.

-: Come on, take a look at this.

Look at this sweet build.

-: And that's it.

Video conferencing

and screen sharing software really is that easy.

And as we move forward

in technology and on our time here on earth

we're gonna need to connect remotely to share ideas, files,

and just to have basic conversations.

So video conferencing and screen sharing software

is something that you're gonna need to get familiar with

as a PC technician.
