-: Now, although most output devices

such as monitors and projectors

typically work straight out of the box,

there are a few maintenance concerns,

and some software settings

that we might need to tackle

in order to configure or troubleshoot them.

Now, first of all with our friend here,

the Epson projector,

one of the main things you need to worry about

with projectors is because they have

such an open air flow in them,

to cool off that bulb,

is a lot of times you'll experience

what's known as intermittent projector shutdown,

and a lot of times it's just caused by

simple overheating.

So you can pop these plastic cases off.

You can clean it out inside,

and sometimes that will fix the issue.

Another big thing with projectors

is your burned out bulbs.

So these bulbs right here,

these are a replaceable commodity.

They have to be changed out

every X amount of life hours in them,

and they can be quite expensive

depending on the projector that you get.

Now, let's talk about monitors.

Everybody's favorite, right?

You'll notice right here on my monitor,

I'm having a little bit of trouble with it.

I think it's because I have not changed

to the correct data source,

and that's something you may encounter.

So let's go ahead,

and switch to our proper data source.

And there we go.

Perfect.

Awesome.

So we've got our desktop here,

but you know what?

I'm not really happy with how this is laid out.

I'd prefer to have it laid out

where my mouse instead of moving off

the right of the screen,

goes to the left and goes to this monitor.

So let's go inside Windows settings here,

and I'm gonna open up our display settings,

and our personalization,

and I actually wanna drag this monitor over here.

My mouse moves onto the other screen

the other way.

So I've changed

the actual layout of the monitors.

And inside here you can do all sorts of things.

You can set different orientations

for your monitor,

such as landscape versus portrait.

We can adjust the brightness and color.

Windows has some great stuff in here

like nightlights.

A lot of times staring at these blue lights

that come out of these monitors for long times,

especially late into the night,

can cause vision issues.

So Microsoft has implemented

a thing called nightlight,

that actually displays warmer colors,

and a more dim monitor

the later we get into the night.

So you can still work

well into the evening hours,

and not be all wired from all that blue light.

Now, a couple of things

you need to be worried about

with troubleshooting monitors.

Number one is, sometimes we have cabling issues.

Right?

Now, don't do this at home, but this is

an old VGA cable that we don't really care about.

So I'm gonna go ahead and just

rip that pin right out.

If you work in an environment

that uses old cables,

such as VGA for your displays,

and you notice possibly a blue tint

or different things going on

that should not be there,

you probably or more than likely

have a bent or broken pin.

This isn't really a concern so much

in modern DVI and HDMI and display port cablings,

but it's still something

that you need to be aware of.

Now, old monitors used to have

a problem called image burn or display burning.

We don't see it a lot anymore

with these new LEDs and LCDs and OLED monitors,

but back in the day with our CRT,

which are Cathode-ray tube monitors,

we used to see that a lot,

and that basically comes from just

having the image on and steady,

not using screensavers.

And after a certain amount of time,

all those pixels

will get burnt right into the screen.

Speaking of pixels, this is a dead pixel.

You might see these a lot.

If you see a dead pixel in your monitor,

that monitor has a physical defect,

and needs to be returned or repaired.

Now, you might also have to deal with

incorrect color displays

in your monitor or dim images.

There's a lot of different things,

but most of that stuff can be handled

within your display settings.

One more thing I wanted to touch on

is a flashing screen,

and this typically is caused

by cable misconfigurations or incompatibility,

such as using a low speed HDMI cable,

in a high speed HDMI environment

can actually lead to that flashing screen issue,

and that's it.

Troubleshooting displays is really that easy

because in the end they are output devices.

So just make sure you check your cabling,

and your settings,

and Windows helps make that easy.
