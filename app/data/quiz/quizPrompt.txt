1) Create a question and answer pair based on the subject matter from information in the xml tags below, and your existing knowledge. 
2) Include an explanation of the answer in the answerExplanationText property. Write this explanation agnostic as to if the user got the question right or not. 
3) create three decoy answers that are incorrect, but still plausable in some way. 
4) store the decoy answers and the real answer in a random order in the optionText property of the options array. 
5) Respond in JSON format.
