        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I completed a Bachelors of Music degree at University of Toronto with honors and became a professional musician. In 2018 I decided to challenge myself, so I joined the Computer Programmer Analyst stream at George Brown College.</p>

        <p>While I attended George Brown, I worked for the college as an English Tutor and peer Tutor in the IT department which taught me good customer service skills. I found that the discipline and people skills that I learned as a musician served me well in this program and I graduated in 2021 with a 3.9 GPA.</p>

        <p> Since 2021 I have been working in IT, first as an IT Support Specialist before being promoted to Operations Support Specialist at an insurance company in Mississauga.</p>
